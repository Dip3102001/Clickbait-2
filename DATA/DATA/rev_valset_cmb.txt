five nights at freddy’s sequel delayed for weird reason five nights at freddy’s creator scott cawthon takes to steam to tease a possible delay for five nights at freddy’s: sister location, the fifth game in the series. cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing five nights at freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for five nights at freddy’s: sister location to carry on that tradition, despite cawthon’s post to the contrary. the next game in the franchise, five nights at freddy’s: sister location, was scheduled to release this coming friday, october 7th, but if developer scott cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months. something else upsetting fans is cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game. for the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the five nights at freddy’s series after another, with four core games, one rpg spinoff, and a novel released so far. cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely "into something kid-friendly." according to a post by cawthon on the five nights at freddy’s: sister location steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark. if the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if cawthon actually does rework it to be more "kid-friendly," or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision. a more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it. alternatively, perhaps cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues. five nights at freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on friday. cawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying five nights at freddy’s sister location from its planned october 7th release date doesn’t make much sense. delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. five nights at freddy’s: sister location is scheduled to launch on october 7th for pc as well as ios and android mobile devices. with october 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not cawthon is serious about sister location‘s delay. source: scott cawthon source: scott cawthon source: scott cawthon fans should also consider the possibility that cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release.
in finding arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on friday, u.s. district court judge murray snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling latinos. "any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame," the immigrant rights group puente arizona said in a statement friday. on may 31, snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether arpaio, the sheriff of arizona’s maricopa county, will be referred to arizona’s u.s. attorney for potential criminal charges. in his contempt ruling, snow said arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile latinos. the ruling friday was one of arpaio’s most serious defeats, but it doesn’t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in november. in a 2011 civil case brought by latino drivers against arpaio and his aides, snow determined that arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. arpaio apologized to snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. in hearings last year, arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself "america’s toughest sheriff," seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge. a lawyer for arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see arpaio reelected. why arizona sheriff joe arpaio’s fate could hang on a single word © reuters/laura segall maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio announces newly launched program aimed at providing security around schools in anthem, arizona, january 9, 2013. chief deputy jerry sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired chief brian sands and lt. joe sousa each were found in contempt on one count. phoenix — a single word — "intentionally" — could transform a court case against phoenix-area sheriff joe arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution. "strong remedies are needed to protect the community’s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct," said cecillia wang, director of the aclu’s immigrants’ rights project. two years later, snow found that arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. at a houston rally the next year, arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order "out of spite" and had arrested 500 people. "in their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, sheriff arpaio and chief deputy sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath." "the court finds that the defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith," snow wrote. the aclu, which brought the original case against arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff’s office. in weighing criminal charges, snow must decide whether arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional. snow found that arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives. arpaio has acknowledged violating snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. in friday’s ruling, arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. he later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly. "willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law." he ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice. "the defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the plaintiff class," snow wrote. in the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for arpaio. longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign. snow declined.
as for tipping on a discounted service: stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. "all the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you," she told instyle. as for your stylist’s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so michelle lee, master designer and manager at salon eva michelle in boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20. but knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands. finally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdresser here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdressermore remembering how much you’re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard — what do current trends dictate? if you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. you can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along. you can always ask the receptionist at your salon what’s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment. not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. if they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert peggy post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%. below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist — and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. and yes, it’s ok to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon. also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. if you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. if you’re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. after all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s. and what if you got a discount on the service? your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon. try to bring cash to tip, if possible. when in doubt, ask at the front desk! is there such a thing as too much? thank us later — no tip necessary.
i hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time i was very much in england as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a new discovery to me. i'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on t-shirts and stuff like that, but i didn’t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. but yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- i’m trying to think back -- i don’t think i ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak. i had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you’re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it’s quite a challenge. rickman: [laughs] the thing about halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it’s so different in england –- we used to have something called bonfire night, and we’d have fireworks. rickman: what i really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. but of course i was also very much around the height of the beatles and the stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. i never trick-or-treated when i was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. rickman: obviously i was aware of the huge rise of the police in england, and as an art student i was very much a fan of talking heads. i went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why i decided to do it, because i have such a love for that. opened in 1973 in downtown manhattan's east village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like the ramones, talking heads and the police, among countless others. halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. it was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. huffpost entertainment snagged some phone time with rickman and grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with cbgb's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. the movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow hogwarts alum rupert grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band the dead boys, alongside justin bartha and bronson adams. i’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and i just thought it was a good time to do it. were you familiar with the legacy of cbgb as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? and it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, i’m enjoying it. it’s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image. the legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars alan rickman as bemused owner hilly kristal. and also dead boys, i wasn’t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on youtube was amazing. obviously i was aware of some of the bands, but not that they’d all started in a club on the bowery. "harry potter" alums reunite for new movie the mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: cbgb. but it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. i didn’t really think about it when i was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. i’ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. i listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me. i'm just here for three or four days for "cbgb" in new york and then back to work in england. because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. i saw emma [watson] the other night in london in a restaurant, and i saw daniel [radcliffe] recently in london because he was doing a play. rickman: i suppose, in my perspective, i’ve played as many of those as i have the other sort. it’s just part of an actor’s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard. once you started exploring the role and got into the dead boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? it's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing rickman, 67, play sinister severus snape in "harry potter" or judge turpin in "sweeney todd." i don’t know if you’re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. not knowing much of the mythology of cbgb, how did you come to learn about your characters? is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera? plus, grint talks about his own punk phase and rickman explains what halloween used to mean for him. i wanted to just try it; it’s something i’ve always wanted to do. and then blondie, but i wasn’t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. they're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including malin akerman as debbie harry, taylor hawkins as iggy pop, johnny galecki as terry ork and ashley greene as hilly's daughter lisa. i’ve tried to leverage it, but i just know it’s never going to happen. grint: it’s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. ... england in the ‘60s and the ‘70s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. i love talking heads, and the whole punk thing was something i really loved. i cut the bottom out and i just wore a yellow bin with a play-doh logo. there are a few videos of him playing live at cbgb and a few interviews i watched. and he was such a nice guy and we had a good time. grint: i'm rehearsing a play that will start [in london] in a couple of weeks. a couple years ago, i did a film that required me to do a liverpool accent. i’m perfectly happy to be colonel brandon in "sense & sensibility" as i am any of those powerful characters. to go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music. the last one, i dressed as a play-doh can that i made. i didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. i like, obviously, the sex pistols and the clash, blondie as well, and the ramones. grint: yeah, there wasn’t really a whole lot to go on. rickman: no, because i think we’d both been so busy doing other things. what were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? yeah, and having [dead boys guitarist cheetah chrome] on set was quite a different thing. it’s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point? this is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. and yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. but i actually had a good costume not that long ago. their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. it never used to be a big thing when i was kid. grint: i didn't actually know a lot about it. there was quite a lot of that in the film. what did you think of the band you were portraying? had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth "harry potter" movie? you had to try out an american accent in this role. did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie? is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character? rickman: i think every english actor is nervous of a newcastle accent. they just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. rickman: i wasn’t familiar with cbgb at all. ... there’s quite a lot of ass in the film. along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, i suppose. so, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. what's your favorite halloween costume you've ever worn? rickman: i don’t even know what that means. which "potter" co-star would you most like to reunite with? that’s disappeared and i know halloween’s taken over. alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera? i don’t want to go into too much detail. grint: it was that whole era that i liked. but yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. he’s always been one of my favorites. so he was on set the whole time? it didn’t really feel that big a deal. to me it just means a soaking wet shirt. the dog collar was a new experience for me. do you have a favorite halloween candy? grint: i don’t know, probably not. just the thought of it scares me. but i enjoy that side of things. i listened to all their songs completely. some amazing people performed on that stage. grint: yeah, i guess it was, yeah. grint: well, literally, i actually made it. is music something you’d ever pursue? i’ve already loved working with them. i’ve worked with julie walters before as well. he’s so cool; just a remarkable guy. i had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. i was kind of surprised he was still alive. did he give you any notes while filming? are you enjoying the theater work? rickman: i'm in new york. grint: i don’t know, really. grint: [laughs] no, not at all. he was such a nice guy. i like that kind of challenge. but no, i really love then. we never really did it. it’s quite a harsh sound. i don’t really know. grint: a favorite halloween candy? grint: i really love them. what are you up to today? yeah, so that's it. it was a yellow bin. especially from justin [bartha] as well. it just kind of happened. grint: not so much notes. "cbgb" is out in limited release now. grint: not really, no, actually. how was it to reunite? grint: yeah, he has a cameo. now for something more fun. and [bob] dylan, very much so. grint: there are so many. one was very shaped by that. i love her, she’s great. i watched old interviews and dvds. it’s not very practical. how did that go down? were you comfortable with that? grint: i liked halloween. i’ve tried that. you know play-doh? that’s really difficult. that’s pretty great. with a yellow hat. i love alan. he plays the cab driver. he was lovely. all of them. it was incredible. of course. the word "chocolate" would loom large. grint: weirdly, yeah. it's october. ... i like michael gambon.
what’s important is that he couldn't puke it back up, and therefore had to poop it into a pasta strainer and then plug it in to a computer to see if the client’s footage was intact. also, they just ran a story about a man who swallowed a 64gb microsd card and then pooped it into a strainer so he could maybe recover the drone footage he shot on it. and it’s not really important why or how he swallowed the card, containing the whole day’s worth of drone footage he’d just captured. do some data recovery experts eventually discover that while the microsd’s controller was broken, the memory was still intact, and everything’s going to be okay john, don’t cry, please don’t cry? the story is written in the first person by "john doe," who is apparently embarrassed by the incident and chose to remain anonymous. a man swallowed a microsd card and you won't believe what happened next! the writers there are passionate and knowledgable about their subject, and love diving into both the art of photography, and the technical gear available for photography. look, i don’t want to ruin this whole story for you. he pooped a microsd card! i can’t believe it! do his colleagues make fun of him forever? does john doe get fired? petapixel is one of my favorite blogs. but man. yeah.
on the other hand, some drinks, including sprite (known in china as xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of aldh and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde. this popular soda could cure your hangovers scientists say: most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and "did-i-get-run-over-by-a-bus" sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover. chemistry world explains it this way: some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. the researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. an herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of adh while inhibiting aldh, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects. a group of chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of "sprite." specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms. after examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher hua-bin li and his colleagues at sun yat-sen university in guangzhou determined that sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms. but what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket? the chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of adh and aldh. edzard ernst, a medicinal science expert from the university of exeter, told chemistry world that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results. the team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body. ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh). do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by? some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. to alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. however, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet. tell us below.

you won't believe this stunning "harry potter" revelation about professor mcgonagall from reading j.k. rowling‘s harry potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and head of gryffindor house, professor minerva mcgonagall. if you recall, one of the reasons why headmaster dippet rejected tom riddle’s application for the dada teaching position, at age 17-18 for tom, was because tom was "too young". but why would dumbledore hire a brilliant mcgonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at hogwarts? after all, the dark lord was probably, "angry, vindictive, and jealous of mcgonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as "what was rightfully his". additionally, in harry potter and the order of the phoenix mcgonagall told dolores umbridge that she had been teaching at hogwarts for "thirty-nine years this december". it seems likely then that mcgonagall started teaching as dumbledore’s assistant in december of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the dada job. dumbledore denied voldemort’s application and as a result, voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any dada professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. but, why would mcgonagall who is obviously gifted in transfiguration initially apply to be the defense against the dark arts instructor? obversa suggests that "professor mcgonagall was originally hired by dumbledore to teach defense against the dark arts (dada) in 1956. as a result of pottermore, we know a bit more about professor mcgonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to lord voldermort’s background). this means that if the wand chooses the wizard, mcgonagall would have been destined for a lot more than transfiguration. dumbledore then transferred mcgonagall to the transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything "bad" or "dangerous" from happening to her. obversa says, "prior to being headmaster, dumbledore served as transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching tom riddle himself as a child. however, not long after, tom riddle (lord voldemort) came back to hogwarts, seeking the dada position for himself. just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between harry potter and himself throughout the entire saga. at the time, mcgonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a hogwarts professor in her own right. reddit user obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire hp saga. after all, as long as she wasn’t teaching dada , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her." stern but fair, mcgonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. the wandmaker ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. however, what if there was something about professor mcgonagall that we never thought about before? however, lord voldemort arrived to hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. thus, when dumbledore succeeded dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of transfiguration." once dumbledore refused, voldy put a hex on the position, so mcgonagall had to be transferred to transfiguration. however, dippet encouraged tom "to come back a few to several years later to apply again". therefore, mcgonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. we know that minerva mcgonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there? order of the phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately september 1995. he was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. mcgonagall was appointed as dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. it’s made of fir with a core of dragon heartstring. he was also mcgonagall’s predecessor, under headmaster armando dippet. take note of professor mcgonagall’s wand.
post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits – but i can’t say that i’m too upset that "star wars: the force awakens" won’t have one. after all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we’re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of "star wars: the force awakens." j.j. abrams has an answer on if there will be a post-credits scene in the new 'star wars' in the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular. because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the "star wars" series as well... but now j.j. abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation. those of you who have been following updates and stories about "star wars: the force awakens" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. after all, they aren’t exactly part of the franchise’s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it’s not a device that has to be used all over hollywood. now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn’t happening – so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action "star wars" movie during the coming attractions. this made a degree of sense, given that the gareth edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time "force awakens" arrives in theaters. the filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or easter egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying: "no, there’s not. the films made by marvel studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the "x-men" franchise movies as well as the latest "terminator." surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they’ll all get over it fairly quickly. if everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it. back in september it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first "star wars" story, "rogue one." as always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and j.j. abrams! the subject came up when abrams was on stage for a "star wars: the force awakens" press conference held today in los angeles. all the scenes are actually in the movie."
kristin cavallari (@kristincav) opens up about just how fake "the hills" was huge fan of all that drama on "the hills"? "what [the producers] would do, if we were out at lunch, if we were out in public, they would text us what to say so that if you were there at the restaurant, you wouldn't see what they were doing," she continued. "so, we'd look at our phones, we'd go, 'blah blah blah, i can't believe you said this, blah blah blah' and we'd look at our phone again." at this point, it's been so many years," the star of the mtv reality series said on "bethenny" on thursday (dec. 20). to find out what else cavallari had to say about "the hills," head over to bethenny. earlier this month, cavallari opened up to andy cohen about how scripted it was. this is hardly the first time "the hills" has come under fire for being a not-so-real reality show. well, it couldn't have been any faker -- just ask kristin cavallari. "it was fun, 'cause you're acting," she said. "and that was more fun for me." i don't care anymore, i can tell you. "i had fake relationships, fake fights.
thankfully, gals like wiedemann and victoria's secret model lindsay ellingson, who actually adds fat to her diet to be "sexier and curvier" for the retailer's annual fashion show, are setting a good precedent for those who want to get in shape in a healthy way. the model (and daughter of isabelli rossellini) is the new face of agent provocateur, and she shows off the brand's signature seductive lingerie in the latest commercial alongside actress melissa george. how 1 model prepares for lingerie shoots the life of a lingerie model is quite a foreign one to us. "i don't normally think of myself as sexy, but when i put the ap lingerie on i felt very sexy -- in control, seductive and powerful," wiedemann told harper's bazaar uk. as for us, we don't plan on participating in a lingerie shoot -- or cutting out sugar -- any time soon. my diet stayed pretty much the same, except i cut out sugar for the week of the shoot." that doesn't sound too bad, especially when you consider the egg powder diet some of her lingerie modeling peers take on before a gig. but participating in brutal castings, undergoing intense preparation and posing in ultra-sexy skivvies have all become routine for elettra wiedemann. she explains: "to prepare i did extra strength work, so weights, and quite a few planks for my core. surely, the famous foodie -- wiedemann hosts an online cooking series for vogue called "elettra's goodness" -- had to change her lifestyle a little as well. "it’s kind of like a superhero suit, albeit quite a skimpy one!" see wiedemann's agent provocateur ad below. first, you have to mentally prepare. so how does one step into such a daunting role?
guess who obama just dined with in vietnam president obama dined on monday night with anthony bourdain in hanoi, vietnam during the president's week-long trip to asia. in japan, he's scheduled to participate in the g-7 summit in ise-shima and mr. obama will meet with japanese prime minister abe to advance the alliance between their two countries. the star shared a photo of them eating dinner at bún chả hương liên, a small restaurant that's just north of the "old quarter" of hanoi, according to the white house travel pool. the white house has said mr. obama won't apologize, however, for the u.s. decision to use a nuclear bomb on the japanese city in 1945. earlier in the day, the president lifted a half-century-old ban on selling arms to vietnam on his first trip to the southeast asian country. he's the third sitting u.s. president to visit vietnam since the end of the war. they're both seen sitting at a table with with lettuce and bowls of soup and mr. obama is holding up a beer. their conversation will be featured in an episode of anthony bourdain: parts unknown, which will air on cnn in september. he'll head next to japan where he'll make a historic visit to hiroshima.
how this 20-year-old died from kissing her boyfriend ctv news myriam ducre-lemay, 20, died in 2012 after kissing her boyfriend — he'd eaten a peanut butter sandwich and wasn't aware of her peanut allergy (or the severity of it) and she was not carrying her epipen with her at the time, ctv news reports. though many outlets report brushing your teeth helps eliminate the chance of an allergic reaction in this situation, the only thing that will ensure it won't happen is waiting a long time after you consume peanuts to kiss. according to fox news, ducre-lemay had recently told people her allergies had decreased in severity, but mccusker said that is only true of every 1 in 5 allergy patients. head of pediatric allergy and immunology at montreal children's hospital dr. christine mccusker told ctv people between the ages 15 to 30 are in the "risk age range" and are most likely to suffer from severe allergic reactions. after the kiss, she had trouble breathing, tried using her asthma pump, and, when that didn't work, asked her boyfriend about peanuts — when he said he'd eaten them, she told him to call 911. according to cjad, ducre-lemay and her boyfriend had been out at a party earlier that night, which is why she didn't have her medication or her medic alert bracelet on her. this is why people with allergies carry "epipen[s], even though you don't want to and even though it's not cool," mccuskey said. en route to the hospital, ducre-lemay suffered cardiopulmonary arrest, which led to cerebral anoxia (oxygen deprivation to the brain). her mother is just now publicizing the story to help others avoid the same situation. "people don't necessarily recognize it can go from that point where, 'i feel funny' to 'uh oh' very fast." emergency crews attempted to resuscitate her with epinephrine, but failed. he attempted to give her cpr before the ambulance arrived. she was taken off the respirator and died.

"so when people met me in person, they’d go, 'wow, you're not at all like i thought you would be.'" "it's more than just a job, it's something that you live, eat and breathe -- to stand up for the victims, to stand up for justice." "i think people saw me on television and got the impression that i was very grim and very tough and very serious," she says. "i'm sure the experience of all the public scrutiny did change me," clark says. "i know that the experience taught me that i don't give up." simpson prosecutor hates being asked as the lead prosecutor in the o.j. simpson prosecutor," clark knows the highly publicized trial led the public to form an opinion of her. since leaving the courtroom, clark has published three novels based on a fictional los angeles prosecutor named rachel knight.

aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the cdc and florida's department of health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including zika. in puerto rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of zika, recommendations from the cdc and the epa to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. by contrast, in miami-dade county, the department of solid waste management's mosquito control section commonly sprays in response to state department of health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide. (cnn) after the first locally transmitted cases of the zika virus were identified in a small area north of downtown miami, officials began to spray an insecticide over a 10-square-mile portion of miami-dade county. although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, phillips said. naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the environmental protection agency (pdf) and the centers for disease control and prevention. "when naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly," said bryn phillips, a specialist in the university of california, davis environmental toxicology department. those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. in fact, dibrom has been used in the united states over the past 50 years, said timothy j. donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of amvac chemical corp ., which makes the insecticide. "you talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're ok with some impacts to the environment," he said. miami-dade county's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called bti (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders. one of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the "low end of the food chain," like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- "basically fish food," phillips said. naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the eu scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. the mosquito control section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. activists organized a june 28 demonstration outside the san juan cdc and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment. since the variety of mosquito that carries zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. if the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, phillips noted. florida reported the nation's first local transmission of zika from an infected mosquito in late july. sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight. his research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of naled. special precautions are not necessary, miami-dade county officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. "it is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year," donnelly said. since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely. yet some environmentalists are not ok with any effects to land and sea, he said. but what was in the insecticide, and how does it work? join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter. the main ingredient of the insecticide, dibrom, is the chemical naled. bti has been registered with the epa since 1961 as a pesticide. during any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees. an outbreak that began in brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the americas. very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. as a result, the eu has banned agricultural use of products containing naled. what are mosquito-control workers spraying in miami? however, in its own review of naled, the european union came to a different conclusion. originally scheduled for wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions. it works by killing mosquitoes on contact. "it's a balancing act," phillips said. zika was discovered in 1947 in uganda.
as monterey bay aquarium veterinarian mike murray said in a 2009 article for popular science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. in a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected. according to mental_floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. there’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird. according to a q&a with proctologist lester gottesman in vice, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying "excuse me" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. a video by asapscience adds that "the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. he added that he thinks birds do fart "in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable." so if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it. this is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. (just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.) several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas. but between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate? the feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. a lot of the gas that makes up a fart, gottesman said, is swallowed air. he also acknowledges that the "wisp of whitish gas" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. according to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer miyoko chu, birds definitely swallow air. in another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. the gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. and a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. (and apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on weisbrod’s observation.) but how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air? and without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers. but the daily dot reached out to the cornell lab of ornithology for answers nonetheless. as far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. but laura eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the cornell lab of ornithology, has a different theory. without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers. he also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart. it’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. a small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. but he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. one of the birds in front of me defecated. but even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? it comes from former cornell student alan richard weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays. have you ever wondered, "do birds fart?" they don’t fart—detectably. do birds fart? that is less clear. well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity. no?

one day, lisa’s friend and an orphanage volunteer posted a photo of an orphaned girl on facebook. feeling in her gut that there was much more to it, lisa paid for a dna test and sent in a swab of aubrey’s saliva. as soon as lisa started posting the photo of the girl on her own facebook page, even her friends and family members agreed. but now that she’s part of a loving family, aubrey couldn’t be happier — but her story has recently taken an unexpected turn. parents discover a secret hidden in adoptive daughter’s family tree life was good for lisa and gene lumpkins. she couldn’t shake the similarities between this unknown girl on facebook and her adopted daughter, aubrey. one of lisa and gene’s adopted children is a little girl named aubrey. that’s when the georgetown, kentucky couple decided to trade in their fancy cars and comfortable lifestyle to adopt four orphans from china — each child with special needs. nothing could prepare lisa or her family for what they discovered next... at one point, aubrey’s birth mom attempted to smother her to death. lisa noticed the girl in the photo looked staggeringly familiar. not only does aubrey have cerebral palsy, but she was neglected and abused by her biological mother. but they realized something was missing. they had two beautiful children. they were financially successful.
a new study from the university of washington’s foster school of business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later. even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings. another recent study covered by the new york times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more "traditional" hours. researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the study, which will be published in full in the journal of applied psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee’s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office. "it seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance," the three researchers wrote in a post for the harvard business review. the one morning work mistake you can't recover from rolling into the office around 9:30 a.m. every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full day's worth of work. "you are implicitly saying, ‘most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.’ and that is where you have this stigma or career penalties." in a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like "sunrise") with words associated with conscientiousness (like "industriousness"). that's why companies like google and microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning. in a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. but the study suggests a downside: your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done. the researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias. past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. that's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 bureau of labor statistics report. bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this "morning bias." "most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation," erin kelly, a sociology professor at the university of minnesota, told the times. although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. the performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. this "morning bias" appears to be deeply ingrained.

but 25 weeks later, doctors drop this bombshell about her babies edwyna and tj were so excited to start a family, but they had no idea it would lead them on journey of incredible odds. because just after she proudly posed for a pregnancy photo, edwyna was rushed to the hospital to stop her premature labor at just 25 weeks. it was unlikely her twins would survive this early on in the pregnancy. it took five hours to stabilize them, and both edwyna and tj were stunned they were borht still alive. edwyna herself is a triplet, and one of her sisters already had twins. sophie and riley were considered "micro-preemies" and suffered a slew of health issues, like chronic lung disease and holes in their hearts. during an early ultrasound, the couple was even more thrilled to discover it was twins. the babies were immediately whisked away and the twins themselves were separated. sophie and riley were born on october 2, 2012 nearly four months early. this tiny little baby underwent four surgeries and faced a blocked intestine and bleeding ulcer. tj whispered into his son’s ear, telling him it was okay to let go if he needed to. riley was especially fragile, and was dealt one terrifying blow after another. but she was blissfully unaware of the heartbreak soon to come. things were still looking normal during edwyna’s second trimester. she understood firsthand the incredible bond between multiples. i can’t even begin to imagine. mom is pregnant with twins.
i suspect apple will make a statement about this sooner rather than later (i’ve contacted the press team), and the two obvious paths are to a) re-release a tweaked version of ios 9.3.2 or b) quickly issue a new update (ios 9.3.3?) a clear pattern is emerging: when affected devices install ios 9.3.2 and restart users are presented with an ‘error 56’ code which tells them to connect to itunes. apple confirms ios 9.3 causes ipad, iphone problems apple confirms ios 9.3 causes ipad, iphone problems apple confirms ios 9.3 causes ipad, iphone problems interestingly, from my initial investigations, it seems the newer ipad pro 9.7 is affected far more often than the ipad pro 12.7 (the two models have key feature differences). but the good news is there are reports of ipad pro 9.7 models updating without problems and iphones and other ipad models appear to be getting through unscathed. all of which does little to aid the reputation of ios 9 which has suffered numerous high profile problems, despite originally being a fine tuning of ios 8 rather than offer a radical overhaul. but beware, just hours after launch, it turns out ios 9.3.2 is hiding a very nasty surprise indeed... apple ios 9.3.2 is bricking ipad pros. ___ more on forbes apple leak reveals 'edgeless display' new iphone iphone 7 leak reveals significant feature removed iphone se vs iphone 6s: what's the difference? needless to say i’d advise everyone (regardless of whether they own an iphone, ipad or ipod touch) to steer clear of ios 9.3.2 until more is known. apple ios 9.3.2 has a nasty surprise today released ios 9.3.2. as for the error code itself, according to apple’s code guide, error 56 is loosely described as a "hardware issue", which doesn’t sound like a credible explanation. the problem is connecting to itunes does nothing, the device is locked and forced reboots only return it the same state. ‘great features’ and ‘nasty surprises’ are my regular columns investigating operating system updates for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines. news of this first appeared on the popular macrumors forums (something the site has followed up) before gathering momentum on twitter where many users posted angry tweets demanding help from the official @applesupport account. on the surface it appears to be a minor update and its arrival was met with little ceremony. iphone se vs iphone 6s review: which you should buy? so what is going on? as an emergency fix. so what happens now?

but when dr. buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- kobe bryant, pau gasol, dwight howard and steve nash -- for what appeared to be dr. buss' last ride, jackson raised his hand. but that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and jackson spent more and more time in new york, running the knicks, and in montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason. his agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for l.a. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture. he would come to los angeles when he could, and she would see him in new york when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect. there had been speculation that jackson could return to the lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from new york. his new york knicks had gotten out of staples center with a win over the los angeles lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic lakers fans on the big screen. those close to jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer. at games, jeanie would sit with her girlfriends linda rambis and stacy kennedy in the second row, across the court from the lakers bench, where phil could see her and the players could hear her. then there were hurdles, such as jeanie buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother jim buss being in charge of basketball operations. this, after all, is the man who won five nba titles in los angeles and was still engaged to lakers president jeanie buss. it was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. and his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court. how distance brought an end to an nba power couple that withstood conflicts of interest and professional trials: phil jackson wasn't in the mood to stop and catch up. those close to buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office. she also has maintained close ties with first-year coach luke walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous lakers coaches. during the best of times, when the lakers were winning nba championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in marina del rey. and not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, lakers owner dr. jerry buss. so during the game, buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for odom as he checked into the game. once on the drive in, jackson mentioned lamar odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. what was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying. so now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. all of those are massive things, that jackson and buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles. jackson and buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. on tuesday night, buss and jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement. as the years went by, jackson focused in on the knicks and buss focused on the lakers. "i think the lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff," jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the knicks' locker room on dec. 11. according to sources, that included a provision that the nba and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry. the engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once jackson became president of the knicks in 2014. and not just any coach: only the most successful nba coach of all time. the way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. so many tangled webs, and yet jeanie buss and jackson somehow made it work for 17 years. the announcement -- via their personal twitter accounts -- brought an end to the nba's version of camelot. his connection with los angeles, and his fiancée, was simply too hard to maintain. if they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships. there was such a distance in the way he said, "the lakers." he had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. at first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. like the camelot in richard burton's broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance. or rather, general manager mitch kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the lakers had chosen to hire mike d'antoni instead. both of their legacies are tied to what they do next. those are the types of implausible things that happen in camelot. so the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end tuesday night. jackson needs to make the knicks into a contender. his knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. this time, the lakers didn't call on him. as always, he would do it for jeanie. the owner's daughter dating the team's coach? once jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. buss must decide whether to reboot the lakers' front office. they yelled out, as odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers' table. it did not break apart their relationship though. about six weeks later, jackson proposed to jeanie buss. it was never meant to be. that was camelot. camelot was over. he beamed at the attention. if anything, it strengthened it. jackson was livid. "take your pants off!"
in the video, an abstract, wooden sculpture clock appeared not to be working, so a male tourist decided to take matters into his own hands, pulling on weights and levers for more than 30 seconds before the clock came flying off the wall and into pieces on the floor. a tourist ignored a museum's "please don't touch" sign, guess what happened next from esquire it was a regular day at the national watch and clock museum in pennsylvania. the museum released security footage from may 31 showing a tourist touching one of the clocks before it comes crashing down from the wall. until a visitor to the museum decided to start playing with one of the clocks. the video is captioned: "this is why we beg and plead with our visitors to please refrain from touching objects in museums." the cuckoos were cuckoo-ing on the hour, and the pendulums were swinging to and fro with each passing second without incident. "there are people who touch things in museums regardless of what you do," museum director noel poirier told nbc philadelphia. people think it's children, but it's really not." only then did he request the assistance of museum staff.

taco bell's newest menu item has one ridiculous ingredient that will leave you questioning everything for some unexplained and ridiculous reason, taco bell decided this hunk of chunk burrito needed "reduced fat sour cream." the thought was sweet and all, but when you're going this big, why act like reduced fat anything is going to make a difference? a play on the regular quesarito, the new dish apparently includes jalapenos and cheese that sit between two tortillas. forget beefy crunch burritos ; t-bell just rolled out a new menu item called the jalapeno popper quesarito. oh, there's one more ingredient we need to mention. if you can book a ticket to charlotte, north carolina, brand eating says you'll find one there. like many of their shock-inducing new additions, it appears to be in the testing phase. although, if it makes a national debut, we're not going to complain. it's kind of like ordering a triple cheeseburger with a diet coke, you know? because being low-cal is the primary function of this burrito, right? look forward to filling of rice, nacho cheese and crispy jalapenos. excuse us while we fall to the floor in unstoppable laughter. you can choose from a ground beef or steak version as well. oh, taco bell. you beautiful hot mess, you. hashtag pointless.
he was referring to rebekah brooks, the former chief executive of news international, a subsidiary of murdoch's news corp. at the time, brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of news of the world, which she oversaw. having risen to the top of britain's media elite, brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former prime minister tony blair, current prime minister david cameron and cameron's communications director andy coulson, who also edited news of the world and served jail time in the coming scandal. did not see that coming: http://t.co/qmob2msxcd — mathew ingram (@mathewi) march 2, 2015 hide yo kids, hide yo wife mt @thr: rebekah brooks to run news corp's storyful http://t.co/bz69bfc5op pic.twitter.com/jc40dc07qz — liam stack (@liamstack) march 1, 2015 brooks' role at news corp and storyful in particular is still in some doubt. a fall from the top, but not from grace brooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from the guardian that her actions began to catch up with her. in june 2009, she took the role of chief executive as news international, a subsidiary of news corp that operates numerous papers including the sun and news of the world. reports from the new york times and wall street journal say that her position will include work on digital and social media initiatives broadly, with storyful being one part of that puzzle. one has to fear for storyful in that rebekah brooks, for all her many talents as a tabloid journalist and editor, has really shown no mastery of social media," jukes said. her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at news corp. that speculation appears to have underestimated murdoch's affinity for brooks. his affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the uk, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him. an odd fit even if some people believed that brooks would eventually return to a role at news corp, few expected her to land at storyful. the startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another london paper — the sunday times — and then stole one of the paper's scoops. those were the words of rupert murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of news of the world in a phone hacking scandal. but it was brooks' bond with murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. "i can say that having toured around the uk talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'why was rebekah put on trial,' but 'why was she found not guilty?'" but reports on sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world. upward mobility brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of news corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in britain at the age of 32. just eight months after being cleared of charges, brooks is set to return to news corp in a role focusing on digital media. the company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the bbc, abc and the new york times, which use content found and vetted by storyful. while brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from news international and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. by january 2011, london law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while brooks led news of the world. peter jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges. founded by journalist mark little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. as the chairman and ceo of news corp, murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility. among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive. news corp bought storyful in december 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company. brooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at murdoch's tabloids. the former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of london's tabloid media. rebekah brooks is back with rupert murdoch, and this time it's digital "this one." jukes noted similarities between brooks's new position and news corp's acquisition of myspace for $580 million. as an editor for tabloid newspapers, she has had little experience with digital media or technology. she once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with princess diana. known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. the inquiries dragged on for years, with brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges. brooks comes off to some as an odd fit for the role. rt @lheron: rebekah brooks to return to news corp to run...@storyful? this aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners. in 2000, she was named editor of news of the world. i feel so sorry for the people i know at @storyful if this is true. news corp declined to respond to inquires about brooks and storyful. the company worked to find and verify this kind of content. in 2003, she became the first female editor of the sun. brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. now, with brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow. the company later sold the social network for $35 million. storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in dublin, ireland. (mashable is also a storyful client.)

your favorite children's book illustrator just got his own exhibition in chicago despite the fact that renowned author and illustrator edward gorey was born in chicago and spent a sizable chunk of his formative years in the windy city, his work has never been recognized with its own exhibition. the second exhibition, "g is for gorey, c is for chicago," pulls from the collection of loyola alumnus thomas michalak, a member of the board of directors of the edward gorey house in massachusetts who has collected gorey material for over two decades. pam ambrose, director of luma, told huffpost the shows aim to address the lack of awareness of gorey's chicago roots in addition to tracing the man's development from a budding artist to an acclaimed cultural icon who inspired creators like daniel handler and tim burton. it includes a number of rare items offering a deeper look at the mysterious man behind the art, including some of his report cards, early drawings and book covers he designed, and the ornately decorated envelopes of letters he sent to his mother, helen. beginning earlier this month and continuing through june 15, the macabre creations of the late gorey are front and center for two concurrent exhibitions at the loyola university museum of art (luma) in chicago. while gorey will forever be linked to gothic subculture thanks in large part to his signature victorian characters dressed in head-to-toe black, the show paints a broader portrait of the artist than that. one of the shows, "elegant enigmas: the art of edward gorey," is a touring exhibition organized by the brandywine museum in chadds ford, penn. "i want people to really think about who this man was," ambrose said," because he appears to be many contradictions in one persona. his influence is also felt in "summerland: a ghost story," a small mixed-media installation by chicago artist kenneth gerleve that's also also included in the show. for example, prominently-placed illustrations of cats throughout the show acknowledge his fascination with felines, and many of his kid-centric illustrations feel downright giddy when compared to his familiar somber style. the luma shows have been a hit -- they had people lined up outside the front door on opening day, "pretty good" for a university museum, ambrose noted. "this is an artist who was much more important than the immediate perception of just the gothic tale or cautionary tale," ambrose said. that offers a comprehensive look at his illustrations as well as work by other artists he influenced. but was this a persona invented to keep people away? tickets to a saturday bash celebrating what would have been gorey's 89th birthday sold quickly. he seems like someone who shapeshifts a bit." it's very hard to say. that is, until now.
fashion brand lets models go un-photoshopped and makeup-free we're just as tired of overly-retouched ads as the next girls, so we've been championing rag & bone's diy project since it started back in 2011. with more publications swearing off photoshop (verily magazine might just be our favorite) and more brands eschewing makeup in ad campaigns, we're happy that a project like this can add to this positive movement in the fashion industry. in case you're not familiar with the concept, the diy project lets models take complete control of the shoot, including the styling and actual photography. rag & bone simply gives the chosen model a bag of clothes and a digital camera -- the rest is entirely up to her, including whether or not she wears makeup. as the campaign closes its third year, we're thrilled that the latest slew of ads starring julia stegner are as refreshing as ever. as for stegner, her beachy shoot features her adorable pup and one of the most effortless haircuts we've seen in a while. thus far, we've seen gorgeous rag & bone styling interpretations by industry powerhouses like lily aldridge, karolina kurkova, miranda kerr, candice swanepoel and carolyn murphy. with julia stegner's new shots, the results are fresh, personal and seemingly makeup-free.

lawrence lessig, a harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the orlando sentinel calling jolly’s bill a "cynical example of fraudulent reform" because "all that would change is that congressmen wouldn’t have to do the dirty work." "but you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you’ve got to go raise $2 million — and that makes members angry." "if you’ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there’s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we’re seeing the results of that," he said. he said he’s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the nrcc, and he said "i don’t buy the notion" that he needs more sponsors before house leadership grants a hearing on his bill. the national republican congressional committee, in a letter to cbs after the "60 minutes" segment, accused jolly of peddling "fiction" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day. i’ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working — returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. then, three weeks ago, "60 minutes" did a sympathetic piece on jolly’s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars. jolly’s democratic sidekick, nolan, said that when he first served in congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground. in february, when rep. david jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the florida republican had only six co-sponsors. the little support jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including democrat alan grayson, also a senate candidate. campaign-finance reformer fred wertheimer told me the idea "is not going to solve the problem," because those working for the members could still solicit funds. has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections — another good idea — but so far he has only one republican, gadfly walter jones (n.c.). jolly is a potential ally of democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that citizens united "could be revisited" and that "we can do better." "we’re looking at the last couple of sessions of the congress of the united states as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. and though the bill wouldn’t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways. the number of co-sponsors on jolly’s bill has jumped from six all the way up to — um, eight. but while jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his senate run. "we’re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money," he said. jolly, appearing monday morning at the national press club with his lead democratic co-sponsor, rep. rick nolan (minn.), was not surprised. "we’ve got six more co-sponsors than i thought we might have," he said. lawrence lessig, a harvard law professor, wrote unfortunately, liberals have piled on. lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system — but nothing happens. well, if everybody’s busy campaigning and raising money, there’s no time for governing." a democratic congressional candidate in florida, businessman randy perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop "soliciting or accepting" financial contributions. democrats talk about overturning the supreme court’s citizens united decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. a member’s political survival depends on raising money — that’s the reality." "in the face of growing crises around the globe, you’ve got a part-time congress." republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) once championed. until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. he calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. the goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. it’s "a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the congress are. "you think you get elected to represent 700,000 people," he said. jolly, now a senate candidate in florida, offers another tack. this is why jolly’s idea deserves a look. but jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman c.w. this, he said, "is a first-rate scandal." lawmakers could do this to fight corruption. the republican party is predictably opposed. no senator has come forward with similar legislation. unfortunately, liberals have piled on. but that ultimate fix isn’t happening soon. in the house, rep. john sarbanes (d-md.) or at least it should. and now? jolly speaks the truth. bill young, continues to agitate. but they won’t. why? .
he rescued this bizarre creature from a sidewalk, but he had no idea what it would grow into jeff longo was wandering in the intense florida heat when he saw a tiny ball of fluff on the sidewalk. and so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in st. petersburg. however, without an inkling of even which species biscuits belonged to, longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her. what’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health. clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major tlc. in addition to getting the gift of life, though, biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with longo, gained a new family. however, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise biscuits on his own. since biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to longo to fill her mother’s shoes. longo, a florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll. indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of longo’s dogs. so, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. that said, given their difference in stature, longo admitted that he had to "watch them so they don’t accidentally squish her." undeterred, though, longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for. so, for two months, longo took biscuits everywhere with him – even to work. the gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. it turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. indeed, longo later recounted how the helpless baby was "half-dead" when they first met. consequently, longo christened the critter biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. they furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds. as each day passed, biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. first, longo went to reddit to ask the website’s online community for help. naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. he even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream. this took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of tampa.

in the comments section of the video, the original poster explains why he thought the fence would be high enough to contain stella: "before i made the fence, i had stella jump a baby gate inside and when she stopped jumping it i added six inches (15.2 centimeters)." in a video posted in july 2014 by youtube user rgraves62002, a man appears to be admiring the result of a day's work in his backyard. at this point, a large dog -- presumably stella -- bounds into view, runs to one end of the fence and jumps right over it, almost without effort. man admires the fence he repaired – now watch what happens just seconds later sometimes, even a job done well is a failure. another comment from rgraves62002 says it is now serving as "a treehouse with a zip-line for my grandson!" "yep, just completed fixing this fence," the man says as his camera sweeps back and forth. in a classic 'blame the dog' moment he adds, "she set me up!" what did the man eventually do with the useless fence? there is a perfectly timed comedic pause, then the man says, "dammit." "pretty proud of it, i'd have to say. try to keep stella in the yard."

in the episode "homer the whopper" , it’s revealed that the celeb trainer lyle mccarthy has worked with pitt and jolie. empowered by seeing so many metaphorical clowns elected to positions of power in 2016, several actual clowns will stand in elections around the world. 14 things that’ll happen in 2017 according to "the simpsons" shit’s gonna be fucked up. as we all know, the simpsons is a sinister oracle with the power to predict the future. it will be revealed that an election was won because of voter fraud, with dead people and pets mysteriously casting votes. facebook’s algorithm will flag fake news but also sarcasm to make sure no one is confused by what they read online. ok, the future’s scary but remember this: one day there will be a female president. it will fail, just like it did in the episode "homer vs. in the episode "love is a many-splintered thing", cumberbatch played the british prime minister. greedy, corrupt energy firms will cause an environmental catastrophe, and a dome will be built over the contaminated site. from the episode "the saved lisa’s brain". benedict cumberbatch will be cast as david cameron in the dramatisation of brexit. from the episode "they saved lisa’s brain". the simpsons said it will happen, so it must be true. angelina jolie and brad pitt will get fat after comfort eating their way through a messy divorce. homer invented it in the episode "wizard of evergreen terrace." so what treats might be in store for us in 2017? there will be a referendum on whether or not to deport illegal immigrants. yep, they predicted president trump way back in the year 2000. prohibition will return to several states in the us. in the episode "sideshow bob roberts", sideshow bob becomes mayor after rigging the election. it will be made illegal to teach evolution in schools. the dome appeared in the simpsons movie. from the episode "lisa vs. malibu stacy". to cut costs, industry workers will be replaced by robots. some alt-right guy will invent the make-up gun. from the episode "mister spritz goes to washington". from the episode, "them, robot". the chandelier in elton john’s private jet will malfunction. from the episode "i’m with cupid". from the episode "the monkey suit". though tbf that’s already happening. let’s see... 1. from the episode "much apu about nothing". stephen hawking will learn to fly. white men will gloat. 14. the eighteenth amendment." 2. and win. 11. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 13. 9. 12. 10. 8.
they include: personality and perseverance propensity to get injured propensity to choke under pressure individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake differences in how we acquire muscle mass coordination height enjoyment of competition "we have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes," she says. put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other. a meta-analysis in perspectives in psychological science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much. it's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a "slow learner" when it comes to sports. "one important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual," brooke macnamara, the lead author of the perspectives paper, tells me. overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular "10,000 hour rule," which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. but it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. it's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best. even more simply: some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. i was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive. here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty. the research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up. baseball: throw a ball at me and i'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. but macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100. more precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. the analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities. on the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try. "we're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything." the analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either. growing up, my dad was on a quest to find "my sport" — the activity i'd finally master. "there’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else," she says. practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid. life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at. which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance." this is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested i shouldn't bother. yet i'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. i'd probably be cut, he said (adding that i was getting very good grades). there was a reason i lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. which suggests "deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill," the study reports. "some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice." by 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. these days i stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. for the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. "so if a person practices, they will get better. i'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine. "all of those things are important and interact with each other. i was really bad at sports in high school. almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance." freshman and sophomore years, i made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle. i played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. tennis: i was cut from the middle school team. they probably had a natural advantage on me. so what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent? but it was mostly a parade of failures. for me, practice did not make perfect. soccer: i was much too slow. lacrosse was the closest we came. "eighteen percent is big," macnamara says. this new study helps me understand why. basketball: all of the above. lo and behold, i now have scientific validation. i love physical activity. "essentially, learning rates vary," macnamara says.
the disclosure paves the way for the show’s new host, trevor noah, and suggests that stewart will not hang around as candidates start to make announcements this year about running in the 2016 election for u.s. president.stewart had said previously that he would continue to do the program until some time between july and the end of 2015. noah is a relative unknown in the united states and has already come under scrutiny for a series of controversial tweets made in past years that were discovered on social media after comedy central announced him as stewart’s heir. stewart’s announcement sets the stage for trevor noah, a south african comic who has hosted a late-night program in that country, to take the reins of the series. he offered few details about what he might do for his final broadcast, but did reiterate a contest that would give a viewer the chance to attend the program’s last taping. the comic announced on monday’s broadcast of the program that he will leave the show after its august 6th broadcast. stewart made the announcement at the very end of the evening’s broadcast, just before rolling the program’s signature "moment of zen" final segment. the viacom-owned network and stewart have both come out in support of noah, urging audiences to give him a chance before passing judgement on his humor. jon stewart has set his official departure date from #thedailyshow jon stewart now has a firm departure date from comedy central’s "the daily show." say it ain't so!
(it's easy to make a case that breathe heavy's photos are the real deal: we know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier tmz story alleging that calvin klein sculpted bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in america gets touched up at some point. while we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that justin bieber's penis is perfectly average—large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement. we can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like justin bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as calvin klein might want us to believe. here, according to breathe heavy, is his assessment: and to make up it, here's a new quote from justin's trainer patrick nilsson, who says jb is packing. another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-photoshop version of the calvin klein shot in which a model gropes him. here is what she told a british tabloid about bieber's d: speaking to the sun, brazilian model tati nevas said: "take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed." here are the two images side-by-side: bieber's team immediately insisted that breathe heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. after exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here: this is perhaps the most revealing shot of bieber's bulge in the wild. a single question now plagues the minds of all americans, weighing down our brains as we slump in our office chairs, then slump in our cars, then slump in our couches, and then slump into bed: how big is justin bieber's penis really? two people claim to have personal connections with justin bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on justin bieber's payroll. arguing in favor of justin bieber's alleged big dick are two people: tati neves, a brazilian model, and bieber's trainer patrick nilsson. shortly after the photos hit the internet, a web site called breathe heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. next we will consult a tumblr called justin bieber's bulge, a blog "dedicated to justin bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge," which is not run by me. these two claim to have seen bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, calvin klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong. here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: have you ever had sex with justin bieber? of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of calvin klein's idealized burmese python. but because bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is. for a tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo. if that claim were accurate, it would mean that calvin klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. for some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one. but in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential american question: what exactly is bieber packing? the swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minders would have us believe that justin bieber has a huge dick. the question, therefore, is: are the claims of the bieber camp correct, and the photo fake? last week, calvin klein released photos of bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign. here is a fan shot of justin bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. in this case, it appears, justin bieber is the same as any man. this is a screencap taken from a video of the calvin klein shoot that bieber himself posted to instagram. or did breathe heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation? nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the calvin klein photoshop controversy. breathe heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. in that since-deleted note, breathe heavy's editor seems to accept bieber's explanation at gunpoint. bieber denies the photo is real, and i respect that and will believe him. there are a number of things we can glean from this photo. that is evidence supporting the theory that justin bieber is adequately endowed. neves claims to have slept with bieber during his infamous brazilian sex romp. "i can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. in fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. how big is justin bieber's dick really? one memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. one is that justin bieber has muscles. have you ever seen his dick? in 2013, bieber went to hawaii and jumped off a cliff. why would bieber's dick be a grand outlier?) last september, bieber appeared onstage at the fashion rocks concert. let's settle this debate once and for all. however we can only work with the materials we have. do you know someone who has? for that, we must consult more candid shots. email me at jordan@gawker.com or leave a comment below. does it look exceedingly large? i'd say not. i sound weird saying that, but yes." let's be true detectives. look at the strong boy! indeed you do. are you scooter braun?
one word that should never follow "i love you" i don’t remember the exact day, or the exact reason, or even the exact words, but i know it started with "i love you, but ..." it could have been "i love you, but you’re driving me crazy" or any of the following: "i love you, but you’re not listening to me"; "i love you, but stop leaving dirty dishes in the sink"; or "i love you, but i need some alone time." i was throwing "i love you" in to soften the blow, but let’s be honest, when you say it like that, the purpose of the statement is to communicate everything except "i love you." what he heard was "i love you if ..." and "i would love you, if only you would ..." he didn’t like it, he said so, and i’m glad he did. i stopped and repeated the sentence i had just said to him with the revision, and the light bulb inside my head nearly blinded me with epiphany. above all else, i want my family to know that i love them regardless of circumstances, even if they are driving me crazy. the "but" slices the top of the sentence off and the "i love you" gets discarded like a strawberry’s calyx. what my husband heard wasn’t the first part of the sentence, but the second, every time. it has made a significant difference in my communication with my husband, and now, my kids. my husband asked if i could replace the word "but" with the word "and." it took me a while to make the change in my delivery permanent, but it was worth the effort. i’ve begun many a sentence with those four words, and never paused for a moment to think about what they mean. "i love you," usually the most beautiful and powerful triad of words in the world, becomes inauthentic and trivial — cheap. "i love you and you are driving me crazy." suddenly, his driving me crazy was no longer an exception to my loving him. i could love him and be driven crazy by him simultaneously! what are we actually conveying when we begin a sentence like that? it was part and parcel of the package. a little conjunction transduction made all the difference. he was right. a throwaway line.
if you've ever dreamed of getting up close and personal with a rocket launch, your time is now on tuesday morning, nasa will broadcast its first-ever rocket launch livestream in 360-degree video, providing an unprecedented vantage point that will make viewers feel as if they are standing on the launch pad at cape canaveral. make sure your virtual reality headset is handy; people who have them will be able to "look around and experience the view as if they were actually standing on the launch pad," nasa said in a press release. the launch of the united launch alliance atlas v rocket—aimed at transporting supplies to the international space station—is scheduled for a 30-minute window beginning at 11:11 a.m. while the minimum safe viewing distance is typically miles away from the launch pad, this livestream promises viewers a much closer look at a powerful rocket launch, or what nasa is calling a "pads-eye view." the rocket will be carrying a cygnus spacecraft made by orbital atk, with more than 7,600 pounds of scientific research, crew supplies, and other materials destined for the orbiting laboratory. the 360-degree livestream will be accessible on the nasa television youtube channel starting 10 minutes prior to liftoff. et.
after the whole hoop summit, i guess there was a little hype, but i never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high, especially after saying that i wasn't sure if i would come or not, worried about basically going from the second division to the nba. i say this about myself, too, and you could probably say it about paul as well: when you see him walk into the arena before a game, you could probably say there's no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight. when you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7-footer, to be able to put the ball on the ground, he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today. 9 pick despite not being sure of his desire to play in the nba at the time, forced folks to change the way they think about 7-footers while he climbed to sixth on the league's all-time scoring list. but it's his shot, the repertoire of fadeaways that he's got, his 3-ball was always money and he's a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block. vince carter, on being traded from golden state to toronto on draft night but then, they drafted him, so i was just perplexed a little bit, like, 'wait a minute, what the heck's going on here?' that's what i hear, so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call: 'ok, we're going to get you if you're available.' "the truth" has played for three teams in four seasons since leaving boston, reuniting with coach doc rivers for his final stop with the clippers, for whom pierce is a part-time player but full-time locker room presence. dirk nowitzki, on his reaction to being drafted by the mavs in 1998 then ross flew out again, and donnie and nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over. a sore right achilles tendon robbed nowitzki of most of the first two months of this season, and most likely a chance to play in the postseason for the 16th time in 17 years, although the big german refuses to give up hope. i remember getting my hat from ["hat lady"] chrysa chin, and then i'm walking up the steps and as i'm walking, i see antawn at the bottom of the steps still. we'd love to come over and see you guys,' because i had said that i wasn't sure if i was coming [to the nba] or not. i wouldn't say he was a great flat-out 3-point shooter, but when the game was on the line, you never really wanted him shooting the 3. because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire, and it's like, 'all right, i have some money in my pocket. i've been around this game for a long time -- a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems. i worked out for them, and toronto told me basically, 'if you're available, we're going to go get you, so you might as well come work out.' once known as "half man, half amazing," carter redefined his game as he aged, becoming a sage role player in recent years, now helping the memphis grizzlies fight for playoff positioning in the western conference. i think i'd be a miserable person, and i'd get on a lot of people's nerves if i'm retired and i have nothing to do. carter's feelings about his basketball future fluctuate, but the old man pulled off a half-amazing 360 layup in traffic on the last night of his thirties against the raptors that raised him. not only did [jamison and i] get to experience the draft beside each other, but we got traded for each other as well, so it was pretty cool. that's one thing, having the opportunity to play with a go-to guy, a superstar like himself, is that he's willing to make the right play. they set a press conference the morning before i left, and nellie was like, 'think about it all night, but we need a decision before you leave.' regardless of how he feels before the game, once the big lights are on and you come on the court, he knows how to get it done, plain and simple. you're having fun, you're competing every year, and then in the summer, it's not like i was just sitting on my butt in my 20s. that's where phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what i'm really passionate about. vince has been on a tear for a while, and paul i don't think is playing much, but you know we're going to try. the bus rides, the plane rides with the guys, i'm enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that i'm going to get with my team. now dealing with injuries that i really never had, it takes the fun away a little bit, but hopefully i can [stay healthy] and have fun. i remember seeing all of the other guys [with the raptors], seeing oak [charles oakley] and antonio [davis] and kevin willis and [hakeem] olajuwon, watching them in their final years. obviously, he's so athletic that once he got going to the rim, you could challenge him, but he was going to put you on a poster. but some days, i'm like, 'man, i'm not ready to walk away from it,' because i still enjoy being in the gym. and he was deceptively quick, so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you, you just hope he missed. i thought i'd be in the top five, and i slipped all the way to 10, so it was a strange night for me. i played national team every year, so literally i took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with holger. but it's kind of like, you do all the preparation to be prepared, but you're not prepared, if that makes sense. it wasn't like they were a great team right [then], not really a playoff team, so you could get some minutes and develop. but what kept him so long in the league now was really his skill level, even though obviously he still has some athleticism, still has some hops. it worked out ok. carter: you finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams, and it's the unexpected. it's something i never really thought about until -- i'm going to say five years ago: just making sure i'm ready. 5 pick -- who was traded for jamison, his friend and north carolina teammate, on draft night -- soared to eight all-star appearances with the toronto raptors and new jersey nets. nowitzki (29,757), pierce (26,361) and carter (24,295) have combined for 80,413 career points and have an outside shot to be the highest-scoring draft trio in nba history. nellie said, 'at the end of the day, if things don't work out, you could always go back to europe.' then i get the phone call like right before and they call your name, and it was just over the moon. i didn't know, because of course, by the time it was happening i was already walking up to the stage. for now, though, the three legends are the only ones left standing from the class of 1998 -- unless you count the no. he's always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted. i actually worked out with holger [geschwindner, nowitzki's shooting coach] those couple of days, and i stayed at holger's house. how is it that you enjoy it, have been doing it all these years but can see yourself [coaching full time]? i've been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare, but he just loves the game. of course, we all know paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3-point line. he'd come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot. i think on my second night, nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me, and fin [michael finley] came and strick [erick strickland] came. maybe not all i know, but all i've done and all i've enjoyed doing at this point. then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like, 'where do i go from here?' as soon as i took the picture, david stern says to me, 'wait right here, there's about to be a trade. i remember in the middle of the night, we got a call and it was [then-mavericks coach] don nelson. it felt like i got drafted, because i was just nervous and excited for him, as if it was me. i remember us playing against each other in the mcdonald's [all-american game] and just being around each other. that's when i met nashie [steve nash] for the first time, because they flew him in for the press conference. i'm sure vince is enjoying that [the grizzlies] are playing well, and paul is enjoying the clippers. i just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as i could with my english. ross was the one who wanted the press conference, but we couldn't even get a tv station there. he puts a lot of time in, and it's different than any other player i've ever seen. dirk wants to play another year, and with his ability to score, he's going to get touches. it really is for me, because i love this game, and i don't want to leave it. and then i go to boston, a team i really didn't like growing up, because i was a lakers fan. they rank behind only the class of '84 (michael jordan, hakeem olajuwon and charles barkley with 82,995 points) and class of '96 (kobe bryant, ray allen and allen iverson with 82,516). we knew either bibby or olowokandi was going one or two, and then after that, it's all hearsay. there are some people who are big and strong, but they don't use it like that. i was on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minutes." but the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for toronto. i mean, he did stuff that i don't think we've seen before in this league. i know this is the last year, so i'm enjoying it as much as i can. i was on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minutes. i was in oakland at his dunk contest in [2000], and nobody's ever seen the stuff that he did. so the next day, i went to the press conference and was like, 'i'll try.' i remember i didn't know who jason williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. it's not always like, 'the play is for me; i have to make the shot.' 'the play is for me; i have to make the right play,' that's his mentality. i flew back with donnie and holger, stayed at nellie's house back in the day. if they don't take the option after three years, you're back home in europe. never had a suit, so i remember right from the airport, we went right to lombardo's [custom apparel in dallas]. i mean, he was my suitemate in college and very good friends, so [i was] over the moon. after being out of the league for six years, traylor died of a heart attack in 2011 while playing in puerto rico. he remains the face of the franchise in dallas, the only nba city he'll ever call home. i was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. but you know, hopefully i can [stay] out there and i can score a few. the first thing i said is, 'dang, somebody's getting traded already on draft night.' basically, here's your hat to that table, here's your hat to this table. "i was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. pierce: i remember slipping and not really knowing where i was going to end up. but when he wants the ball, he's going to say, 'give me the ball.' i mean, he was a tough matchup because he could post, and he was so freakishly athletic. he'd run a pick-and-roll going to his right, where he was always deadly. you put a smaller guy on him, he was able to post and shoot over him. next thing you know, you're 30 and you're sort of like a mid-aged guy. nowitzki: i was always the young guy, the german wunderkind, the young guy coming up with talent. i remember like maybe two or three media people showed up, because it was on such short notice, right? there's some mornings i wake up and it's like, 'is it one more year? but if you stay busy, if you have a blast ... now, i'm still trying to compete. the forgettable career of the first overall pick, los angeles clippers center michael olowokandi, has been over for a decade. i enjoy it, but i don't know if i want to do it. that's always an option after two or three years [when] your contract is over. at least a couple of his draft classmates are still around to help carter celebrate his birthday. i think as you get older, it's more important to be on a winning team. well, antawn i guess got the word that there was going to be a trade. people are like, 'oh, you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit.' as of thursday morning, vince carter is the lone member of the nba's active 40-and-older club. 8 larry hughes -- all enjoyed some success but combined for a grand total of two all-star appearances between them. 6 and swapped for a floppy-haired german kid a few picks later in a deal with the milwaukee bucks. other than that, i'm ready to go when the time is [right]. then [mavericks gm donnie nelson] and nellie came maybe a couple of days later. i had this press conference in this small little hotel that i'll never forget. they said, 'hey, don't make a decision before we fly you to dallas. when the camera starts getting close to you, you figure they're talking about you. i really can't see myself as a coach as of right now. in the locker room, on the court, i'm just soaking it all in. pierce: he had unique ability, something you hardly see: great athleticism and great shooting touch. so it was kind of like, 'ok, well, they just really wanted him.' i guess it makes sense, but to me, it still doesn't make sense. nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town. that's what we were hearing, so i took my workout and everything. the active trio has long stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class. then just spending and spending, and you hear the next horror story that they go broke. i remember saying, 'man, what do you think is going to happen?' it's something this league has not seen in a long time. he was a competitor and really just a great all-around player. he had the big body and he knew how to use it. i remember sitting at the table next to me was antawn jamison. we want you to see everything and meet some of the guys.' it felt like the next thing you know, i was 30. dirk nowitzki, 38, hopes his body will let him play at least one more. i guess the end of the story was, 'we'll try.' that was a huge jump, and i was a little worried. all the extra work you have to put in to stay ready. i know that, so i'd have to find something to do. so my 20s, i felt like they were over in a heartbeat. i know it's near, and i'm preparing myself for it. i've had many, many, many great battles against him and know him very well. the '98 greats separately sat down with espn recently for a three-way q&a. i had the worst jacket on, and we had a press conference. i remember i was sitting with holger around the pool for hours. 34 raised to the rafters in boston alongside the other celtics greats, presumably pretty soon. but i think lebron [james], [dwyane] wade and [carmelo anthony] are going to crush it. 'whoa, dallas took a chance on me at frickin' no. obviously, it's not as easy as back in the day. then the last few years, you're just the oldest guy. i guess it was meant for me to be in boston. couple of young guys, but still a couple older guys. because i only worked out for the top five teams. there's nothing better when you've done this so long. our families were sitting next to each other, laughing and talking. i still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking. "'whoa, dallas took a chance on me at frickin' no. you know, you're just living in the moment. dang it, it was me, and it all came together. i think it's possible if we stay healthy. he's all about the good of the team. now, i'm prepared to move on to phase 2. but nevertheless, i was excited for him and like, 'whatever.' he was like, 'hey, we just drafted you guys. paul pierce, 39, knows this season will be his last. in the broadcasting world, i can see it clear as day. and when it mattered, he made big shots. i mean, god willing with health, of course, and opportunity. nowitzki: i didn't go to the draft. could drive both ways, even ran some pick-and-rolls. it's amazing how 19 years just have flown by. i mean, he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint. i had concerns about making that huge jump. 10 pick, will one day see his no. i'd never lived anywhere but with my parents. robert "tractor" traylor was selected by the dallas mavericks at no. i'm putting all of the pressure on him. that's something that i vow never to do. the coaching thing is still up in the air. mind you, everybody [at their tables] had their hat fixed perfectly. three remain from the class of '98. the rest of the top 10 -- no. there was literally like three people there. [then-mavericks owner] ross perot came in the private plane. then the next night was our decision. he's been like that since high school. i'm not a vacation guy like that. it wasn't on tv back in germany. i get asked about it all the time. but you know, things happen for a reason. pierce: it's going to be tough. olowokandi, ok. bibby, ok. raef lafrentz, great. from there, you really didn't know. some days, i'm ok with it. i was like, 'hey, what's up?' our only chance is vince carter now. i'm holding my hat, looking at it. i heard anywhere from three to eight. carter: first of all, his work ethic. that's why he was sitting there. then dirk will come in and drop 35. he was fun to watch during his prime. for me, an idle mind is just awful. great pump fake, could get to the foul line. you try to play it cool. i mean, those guys were prepared. he's just another professional scorer. i can't just sit around. nowitzki: vince just had unbelievable athleticism. we couldn't watch it anywhere. man, we've got a shot. but then it all made sense. i'm enjoying the ride, man. he had the combination of both. pierce: dirk changed the game, man. it was a pretty cool thing. all three of us are competitors. i'm still fighting with that. or is it this year? i was like, 'this is crazy!' i can't do that. that's not who i am. we've got a shot. i'm not playing much. i wouldn't like it. lebron, wade and melo are coming. it's not looking good. it's just the weirdest thing. it's all you know. 7 jason williams and no. it was so bizarre, so bizarre. or is it three years?' then i started looking around. he was a transcendent player. it kind of clicked from there. i mean, he revolutionized the game. players like that are transcendent. they called antawn at four. he's a professional scorer. he'd get to his spots. they had a young team. we'll go from there.' those years just flew by. he was a clutch shooter. i just remember sitting around. if you stay busy, time flies. i'm enjoying every moment. pierce: oh, it's fun. carter: i'm a little uneasy sometimes. usually you see one without the other. i can never decide on a number. it blindsides me, pretty much. 3 raef lafrentz, no. we need some work. 'this could be it.' that sounds like a lot. so i agreed to that. it was just weird. he loves to play. they showed up in wurzburg. where do i go?' had a press conference. nowitzki: he was strong. all three are legends. carter: it's possible. and they're coming fast. ok, i step back. so that night was rough. carter: he was a killer. he loves to compete. obviously, i had concerns. he definitely had the clutch gene. i enjoy doing it. 23 overall pick, cleveland cavaliers head coach tyronn lue. dirk has been hurt. 2 mike bibby, no. 4 antawn jamison, no. we had no idea. shootaround, i'm enjoying. and he's selfless. carter, the no. nowitzki, the no. pierce, the no. but who knows? it was bizarre. paul used it. it was incredible. it's possible. it was unbelievable. it was incredible." that's rare. nowitzki: [heavy sigh.] not yet. 9?' scary.

as vanity fair’s kurt eichenwald pointed out while most newspaper endorsements don’t influence voters the way they once did, it’s rare for historically conservative papers to endorse a democratic candidate for president. for the first time in its 126-year history, this newspaper endorsed a democrat the arizona republic has only endorsed republican candidates for president in its 126-year history but this year is different, the paper’s editorial board wrote on tuesday. while most newspaper endorsements don’t influence voters the way they once did, it’s rare for historically conservative papers to endorse a democratic candidate for president. the paper praised clinton’s leadership, and wrote that the democratic candidate’s stance on immigration issues is far closer to what arizona residents want than anything trump has suggested. the endorsement editorial, which said the paper has "a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and republican principles," praised clinton for her experience, and trashed the gop nominee. the arizona republic is not the only conservative paper to endorse clinton this year. as vanity fair’s clinton has received far more newspaper endorsements, many from conservative papers, than trump. the editorial also called out trump for consistently making degrading comments toward women and minorities, which it said show "a stunning lack of human decency." the paper wrote that trump’s lack of control poses a real threat to national security and called his recent "conversion to conservatism unconvincing." hillary "clinton has the temperament and experience to be president," the board wrote. " has the temperament and experience to be president," the board wrote. " in june, the dallas morning news endorsed clinton and bluntly stated that trump did not deserve its readers’ votes. new hampshire’s union leader this month published a blistering editorial condemning trump’s candidacy, and endorsing libertarian gary johnson. "instead of offering solutions, he hangs scapegoats like piñatas and invites people to take a swing," the editorial said. donald trump does not."
"we were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn’t know where they would be discovered," said elizabeth p. murchison, a cancer biologist at the university of cambridge who was not involved in the new study. he and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals — known collectively as bivalves — had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why. tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. they concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams. but they did discover that dna in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams. dr. goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers. transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. but last year, stephen p. goff, a molecular biologist at columbia university, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams. carol reinisch, a marine biologist at environment canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort. even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species’s own cells. instead, the scientists matched the cancer’s dna to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of spain. with eight contagious cancers now on the books, dr. murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought. "that’s really quite incredible," dr. murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer. the evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body. the new research "does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans," dr. murchison said. however they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. in shellfish, dr. murchison said, "we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way." but dna in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed. for years, tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer. but dr. goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease. in every case, the researchers reported in the journal nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious. "somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast," dr. goff said. but in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host. after examining the dna, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor. the two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams. the new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier. in 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer. they chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams. as it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains. the mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters. "i don’t think we should be starting to panic," dr. murchison said. yet it’s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power. scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago. it killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind. so should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? they hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body. she suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host. from new york to prince edward island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s. in the 1990s tasmanian devils in australia began developing deadly face tumors. there have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer. either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started. for help, dr. reinisch turned to dr. goff. a second strain of the cancer was identified last year. "we are now at four for four," dr. goff said. in the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. an estimated 0.04 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example. a decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. these mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses. the tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. "they might be emerging fairly often," she said. cancer is contagious among clams. what about us?
a lifeway research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, "i believe the battles in syria are all part of the prophecies of the book of revelation," and 32 percent of them said yes. 1/3 of americans believe this about the syria conflict most things aren't really the end of the world, but one-third of americans who were surveyed believe that the syria conflict is an indication that our days are numbered. though he believes the bible does predict future events in the middle east, the author of the end: a complete overview of bible prophecy and the end of days said that he "does not think the trouble in syria was predicted in the bible." twenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that "u.s. military intervention in syria might lead to the battle of armageddon that’s spoken about in the book of revelation." a biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of damascus and links it to the coming of armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen. stetzer said that he could see why attaching biblical significance to the syria conflict would appeal to many christians, because, "for christians, the end of the world doesn’t mean despair. location and income also skewed the results, with southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect syria with the end of days. gender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between biblical prophecy and the current situation in syria. in addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, "i believe the world will end in my lifetime." mark hitchcock of faith bible church in edmond, okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times "want to know that god is in charge. however, syria's shared border with israel, as well as the explicit biblical mention of damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses. isaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating syria to the end of the world. he said that previous u.s. military actions like the war in afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on bosnia "didn't get the same reaction." (king james version) ed stetzer, president of lifeway research, was surprised by the results of the survey. they want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel," according to lifeway. behold, damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. the end is really a new beginning." it states: the burden of damascus. the rev.
the horrible incident that cut my honeymoon short the honeymoon is the light at the end of the tunnel for many brides and grooms-to-be who have had it up to here with wedding planning. after hitting a speed bump and falling off of the vehicle, her husband shattered his shoulder and rudner rotated her hip, cutting the trip short. at a stop in mykonos during their cruise through the greek isles, rudner and her husband rented atvs. "at least i get my checkmark for 'in sickness and in health' and 'for better or for worse,'" she said. in a huffpost live segment that aired tuesday, alejandra rudner told host caitlyn becker about the disastrous events that plagued her european honeymoon. but unfortunately, the much-awaited trip doesn't always turn out as planned.
this drug could add five years to your dog’s life when examining the benefits of a drug that extends life expectancy, it’s not enough to look at how many years are being added on, but the quality of the years being added. after the results that have been seen in the mice study, the researchers believe that they could see a dog’s life extended by up to five years by making them more impervious to health issues such as cancer, kidney failure, and dementia. geneticist daniel promislow told the telegraph: "if rapamycin has a similar effect in dogs – and it’s important to keep in mind we don’t know this yet – then a typical large dog could live two to three years longer, and a smaller dog might live four years longer." promislow remains optimistic on both fronts, saying, "if we can understand how to improve the quality and length of life, it’s good for our pets and good for us. the drug is currently being tested on 32 middle-aged dogs (6-9 years old) for its affects on both increase canine longevity and dogs’ overall health. not only would it increase the length of dogs’ overall lives, but it would compound that by increasing their number of "good" years. researchers at the university of washington’s dog aging project are quick to point that out when they talk about their hopes for rapamycin. the trial will last up to six months, after which, the dogs will continue to be monitored to hopefully determine an increase in life expectancy. a longer trial is underway to determine how extended treatments with rapamycin affect the longevity in dogs. the drug, also known as sirolimus, was originally developed and prescribed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs in humans, and also to fight cancer. however, in low doses, rapamycin was shown to slow aging processes and increase the lifespan of mice. it’s win-win."
"our core commitments as a catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the university's health plans," engh wrote in the letter. "an elective abortion is a serious moral evil, and if it’s in our power to end that on whatever level we can operate, we should do our best to end that moral evil," bretzke said to cbs. just this week, loyola marymount university, a catholic university in los angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year. another catholic university drops abortion coverage a second catholic university in california this week has dropped elective abortion coverage for its staff. president obama's affordable care act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage. health plans must cover birth control under the affordable care act, but obamacare allows employers to offer plans that restrict abortion coverage. the move appears to be part of a trend among catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-catholics, the los angeles times notes. in a letter dated oct. 3, santa clara university president michael engh announced the 2014 change to the jesuit university's 1,600 employees. the move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made. the change by the universities moves in the opposite direction of california's abortion law. father jim bretzke, a professor of moral theology at boston college, sympathized with santa clara's decision. "they believe that that is a moral evil and so they’re pursuing dropping that from their packages."

if you’re more interested in playing the "hater" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don’t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but oklahoma wesleyan isn’t one of them. everett piper, president of oklahoma wesleyan university, weighed in with a letter to the campus community: this past week, i actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt "victimized" by a sermon on the topic of 1 corinthians 13. oklahoma wesleyan is not a "safe place", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn’t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that’s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that’s wrong with them. this fall, protests at yale, princeton, duke and the university of missouri — where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil — drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus. so here’s my advice: if you want the chaplain to tell you you’re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you’re looking for. if you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place. we don’t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don’t issue "trigger warnings" before altar calls. it appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! the goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins — not coddle you in your selfishness. anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them "feel bad" about themselves, is a "hater," a "bigot," an "oppressor," and a "victimizer." this is a place where you will quickly learn that you need to grow up! that feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! the protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable. the primary objective of the church and the christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization! i have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. we believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. an altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! in his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable. college president to students: "this is not a day care. it is supposed to make you feel guilty! at okwu, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. we are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. we want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! this is not a day care. i’m not making this up. this is a university!" this is a university!
'some people like to cuddle, others like to be alone and there are others who experience what is described as post-sex blues.’ psychotherapist and sex therapist phillip hodson, author of how to make great love to a man, said: ‘the sadness some men feel at this point may be due to the contrast between the joy of arousal and feeling like a superhero and the sensation of the feel-good hormones wearing off.’ and while women have a reputation for becoming emotional after sex, he added: ‘i think men get emotional too, but they don’t show it.’ and while women have a reputation for becoming emotional after sex, he added: ‘i think men get emotional too, but they don’t show it.’ and while women have a reputation for becoming emotional after sex, he added: ‘i think men get emotional too, but they don’t show it.’ how men can get the bedroom blues too they have a reputation for nodding off afterwards – and now it seems making love can make some men depressed, too. in fact, they can become so sad and emotional that they suffer ‘post-coital dysphoria’ (pcd), according to a report. but in recent years doctors have heard complaints from male patients that they can go into deep depression and feel achy and irritable for hours after sex. until now it was assumed only women suffer pcd, with nearly half reporting feelings of sadness, anxiety and tearfulness at some point. the report’s author, professor robert schweitzer, of queensland university of technology in australia, has studied data from both genders, and says pcd is ‘not uncommon’ in men. he said: ‘there are a wide range of responses in the period of time immediately following sexual activity, known as the "resolution phase".
ms. lepucki is a graduate of oberlin college and the university of iowa writers’ workshop, and is the founder and director of writing workshops los angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008. she might be the only author to benefit from the amazon-hachette war thanks to stephen colbert "i felt kind of icky to be benefiting from this fight," ms. lepucki said. over breakfast in los angeles, where she grew up, the freckled ms. lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke. how ms. lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the amazon-hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck. mr. colbert invited mr. alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by amazon’s refusal to take hachette preorders. but the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, erin hosier, called "the novel equivalent of a harmony korine movie," failed to sell to a publisher. she had another confession to make, too: yes, she shuns amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of bag balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders. ms. lepucki found herself in portland, ore., this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore powell’s books, where "california" hit no. "i honestly suspected it wasn’t going to be my kind of book — too earnest," mr. alexie said in a telephone interview. mr. colbert’s promotion of "california" started with sherman alexie, an anti-amazonian and national book award winner for "the absolutely true diary of a part-time indian." mr. alexie said that he asked hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse. little, brown and company, the hachette division behind "california," has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour. ms. lepucki winced when asked if the couple in "california" is modeled on her and her husband. but insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed. a young couple, frida and cal, have fled the ruins of los angeles to make a home in the wilderness. "california," which arrives on tuesday, is now one of the most preordered debut titles in hachette history, according to a company spokeswoman. "if you don’t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, i don’t think you’re really human." even before the boost from mr. colbert, "california" was receiving praise from respected novelists like jennifer egan and ben fountain and popping up on summer reading lists. "i’m madly in love with my husband, but it’s not us," she said. "you really can’t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials," ms. hosier said. and it has a twist: her husband, patrick brown, is employed, in a sense, by amazon. it’s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, dixon bean, while writing. "occasionally, my brain would overheat, and i’d forget how to write," she said of her signing session. (her mother-in-law’s response to the book: "i’m sad she killed me in a blizzard.") "but i started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner." "amazon has historically been a bully, and i don’t shop there," ms. lepucki said. "people seem to hate frida, so i hope i’m not her." she is also known in book circles as a writer for the millions, a highbrow literary website. he works for goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; amazon acquired it last year. ms. lepucki’s agent is negotiating rights with the producer gregg fienberg and killer films. it seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious. everything changes when frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats. still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously. but ms. lepucki sees it as a love story. "i have a darker imagination than most people," she said. 1 on the best-seller list after mr. colbert directed viewers there. "we finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful." "at the same time, the opportunity to reach readers is a fantasy." "california" was on the top of the stack. "i did still wonder whether anyone would care," she added. "it was overly ambitious," ms. hosier said. with its post-apocalyptic setting, "california" mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction. "california" is actually her second novel. that put more pressure on "california." little, brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers. "i had a chapped elbow," she explained. "my signature is like a squished spider." "but i love goodreads. but no. for the record. oh, they care. and my marriage."
tim said that at kentucky’s business school he took a class in his sophomore year — in which he met amanda, incidentally — and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you’re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it’s historically returned, you’d have $1 million when you were 60. spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between april 4 and april 7 in fort lauderdale, fla. meet the nfl player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) tim masthay, of the green bay packers, and his wife amanda are the best team in the nfl when it comes to personal finance. "finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there’s something we can do that’s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn’t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?" how they got so smart about money the masthays said their educations at the university at kentucky — he was an economics major and she was a marketing major — were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential. the unique financial challenges of being an nfl player — and the wife of a player when you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, tim said. "if we ever went on vacation as kids, i remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and i would do chores around the house and go wash people’s cars and save up for my spending money," amanda said. how the nfl keeps its players from going broke (1:58) see what it's like to attend the nfl's personal finance camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing. what it’s like to make so much money while you’re in your 20s tim wasn’t drafted out of college but was signed — and released — by the indianapolis colts before the 2009 season started. when we asked the masthays what they did with his first big nfl paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league’s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children. also see: what it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of nfl players tim, 29, met his wife amanda while they were sophomores at the university of kentucky. and when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they’re not happy with the advice or returns they’re getting, tim said he’s never had one. marriage and money amanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the personal finance camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season. when we asked tim what he thought helped him go from being waived by the colts in 2009 to setting records with the packers in 2011, amanda said: "he married me." tim and his wife amanda recently attended the nfl’s personal finance camp, which educates players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing. "there was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn’t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience." "it took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn’t buy some car that we really couldn’t afford," she said. this nfl player slept in a utility closet in college to save money green bay packers punter tim masthay was obsessed with saving money before he even had any. tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. one way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. you would think one of the professors leading the classes at the camp said this, but tim did, after being asked why he attended. "we receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you’ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. so much so that he slept in a utility closet in college because it reduced his rent to only $100 a month. they’ve since sold the kentucky home but say they didn’t like owning a home they only used for part of the year. they bought a house in kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in green bay. that made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. he said another challenge is that they’re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. amanda masthay while tim was trying to make an nfl roster, amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. but he also acknowledged that "if you have some vision for the future, it’s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment." "by the time i graduated i had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. it’s a little different way of being paid than i think most people are," tim said. during the interview, amanda and tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other’s sentences. because it’s very difficult to project how much you’re going to earn in an nfl career. they’re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? so we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. he later signed with the green bay packers and has had great success with them. it might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career." they married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way. he signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $1.2 million signing bonus. i almost fell on the floor when i saw his first paycheck. it doesn’t matter if you’re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between. i almost fell on the floor when i saw it. i had never seen that much money in my life," amanda said. they were tempted to buy things when they got the check. if you’re old or young or single or married. that’s what i bought her wedding ring with," he said. "i remember thinking, wow that’s interesting," he said. and he won a super bowl with the packers in 2011. and if you’re wondering how many credit cards they have. tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate. he said it was just big enough to fit a bed. (he spent part of it on the ring.) he invests his money himself in low-cost index funds. "that was all the money we had. tom szczerbowski/getty images tim masthay punting in a game against the buffalo bills on dec. 14, 2014.

emmy-lou explains that all you need to do is close your eyes or simply stare at a fixed point if you are at your desk for example and place your feet flat on the floor for stability. then start counting the breath in and out through the nose as per the breathing ritual in the pink box. 'a sigh is wonderful as it's effectively telling the body that we are going to hit the reset button on the pattern,' she said. next, turn all focus to pulling in your breath, sucking the oxygen deep into your belly through the nose as though pulling breath in through two straws up the nostrils. emmy lou says you should repeat this eight times - or at whichever number feels good and comfortable for you - visualising and allowing the shoulders, eyes, mouth and brow to soften. speaking to femail, she explained: 'when worry kicks off and stress kicks in, you need to make space. so what if there was a simple three-minute solution for clearing your mind and erasing your worries instantly? according to emmy-lou knowles, mediation coach and intuitive healer at www.youremmylou.com, there is - and anyone can master it. how to completely banish stress in just three minutes juggling high-pressured jobs with starting families and maintaining social lives is leaving our generation highly anxious. you don’t need incense, candles or to be sat legs crossed on the floor – let’s be realistic.' then, simply sigh.
lawmakers are going to punish university for not shutting down "sex week" a group of conservative tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the state's flagship public university over a student-organized event in early march called "sex week" -- by dramatically cutting back its ability to host guest speakers. state lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the university of tennessee (ut) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to "engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events." last week, two other state senators -- education committee chairwoman dolores gresham (r-somerville) and government operations committee chairman mike bell (r-riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward sex week. sex week organizers told huffpost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an ut administrator said in february that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni. they are being pushed in response to sex week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at ut's knoxville campus discussing sexuality, lgbt issues, sexual health and related topics. ut administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard. bell and gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. university leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block sex week because the first amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. but ut system president joe dipietro told the chattanooga times free press that the university did not have "any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program." another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers "proportionally based on membership" of the student groups inviting the speaker. sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized. "if people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, i think that could have a significant impact," ut faculty senate president david golden told the tv station wate. nonetheless, the tennessee state house has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized sex week, which the house called "an atrocious event." a ut-knoxville graduate student provided the huffington post with a form email she received from campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. both of these bills were authored by state sen. stacey campfield (r-knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on wednesday. campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his "don't say gay" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (the legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.) "i can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus." the legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013. on monday, a petition opposing campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. the lawmaker said: while i support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. bill haslam (r) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law. attendance at sex week increased this year, according to the school's daily beacon. in addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers friday. gov.

however, as understanding science explains, "although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science." see also: 6 questions to ask before sharing science on the internet "and, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. however, as understanding science explains, "some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable." diego andrés golombek, a professor at the university of quilmes in argentina, told quartz, "astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment." there haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. the guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an aries, taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient. so, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a scorpio or a taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. a hospital in argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. there are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the university of california, berkeley’s understanding science website lays out a "science checklist." so far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid. for instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance. you should read this next: science explainer: why gmos aren’t harmful to your health you should read this next: science explainer: why gmos aren’t harmful to your health you should read this next: science explainer: why gmos aren’t harmful to your health further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality. so, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology? yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science. for something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. does it attempt to explain the natural world? unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity. explainer: is there any science behind astrology? photo credit: pixabay.com looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint. until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience. does astrology use testable ideas? does it rely on evidence? 2. i am horrified by this prospect!" 1. 3.

(sic) "really depends if she is coming or going. it tells if she really cares for her hygiene" "hair and hair color. i'm a sucker for a pretty face." naturally, we weren't satisfied just knowing where they were looking. they're easy to look at without drawing attention to yourself." we had to know why. it's your face! here are some riveting insights: "boobs. "ring finger to see if she is taken." so yeah, guys are still way creepier. and the winner might actually surprise you. so there you have it. "face and smile. cuz i like boobs." "face and breasts simultaneously." (that must take some practice?) "her butt. "her legs. what?!? interesting, right? does it? "her outfit. hm. womp. aw! groan. strategic.

morgan stanley analysts estimate that amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores nordstrom, sears, macy's, kohl's, jcpenney, and dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. "we expect online (primarily amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that amazon is gaining traction in fashion," the analysts wrote in a recent note. that's more than the combined online sales of macy's, nordstrom, kohl's, gap, and victoria's secret parent l brands in the same period, according to bloomberg. over the past couple of years, amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first new york men's fashion week. in a 2012 interview with the new york times, amazon ceo jeff bezos gave a simple reason that amazon was investing in fashion: "gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item," than with cheaper products, he said. the company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as julie gilhart, the barneys new york fashion director whom amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor caroline palmer. department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the us, with its apparel sales totaling $16.3 billion last year, bloomberg reports. also in the past few years, amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as zac posen and stuart weitzman. amazon is now second only to walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to morgan stanley analysts. an unlikely company is crushing america's biggest clothing stores an unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: amazon. the apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to morgan stanley. but department stores' loss so far has been amazon's gain, according to morgan stanley analysts. amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of the clothing website shopbop. the company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things for which amazon is necessarily known. three years later, amazon bought the online shoe retailer zappos for $850 million. but amazon's strategy appears to be working. that shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads.
the majority of people don’t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it—bacteria that you’re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up. not washing your feet you might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you’re in the shower, so there’s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. you’d be wrong, though. using scented soaps yes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time. showering in hard water some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage. those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation—it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. if you don’t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you’re done using it so it can air dry. if you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you’re out of the shower. avoiding cold showers most people wouldn’t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that’s anything less than steaming hot. this video demonstrates why: consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you’re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying. there are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment. the water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you’d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly. it’s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that, you know, there’s actually something there worth exfoliating.' over exfoliating giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you’ve never thought of. anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result. there’s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore—imagine what you’re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash. 3. if you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it’s because the blades are dull and it’s time for a replacement. still, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. using a soap dish yes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn’t that good of an idea. razors, whether you’re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive—so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work? if you’re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals. not only that, but if you’re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way. leaving your razor in the shower remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? some people can’t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there. those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker. use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea. washing your face without a doubt, it’s easier and less messy to wash your face when you’re already in the shower. in addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time. anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. even if you’re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it’s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. plus, you won’t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create "questionable" smells. not washing or replacing your loofah regularly be honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? however, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? shower habits you need to stop doing immediately did you know theres actually a right way to shower? for anyone who doesn’t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so. showering is—and should be—a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. using old razors for most of us, old razors aren’t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. a quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate. check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good. well, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn’t mean it’s doing so effectively. instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. however, despite the convenience, it’s actually not good for your face. here are the things you need to stop doing while showering. get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. as it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. the same thing goes for your razor. 7. years? 6. 1. 2. 10. 8. 5. 9. 4. months?

"they were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction," says "they were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction," says shirley lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the city university of new york. dr. ermias belay, a prion disease researcher with the centers for disease control and prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is "definitive evidence" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species. people have developed variant cjd after eating the meat of cattle infected with but while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades. as one medical researcher as one medical researcher described , "if the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects." but lindenbaum, who continues to but lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. belay says the disease is "a little bit concerning" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, about one in a million people in the u.s. develop cjdthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. courtesy shirley lindenbaum hide caption toggle caption courtesy shirley lindenbaum when shirley lindenbaum visited a south fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, "see how many children we have now?" as as another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. "so, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body — taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies," says lindenbaum. courtesy shirley lindenbaum but while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades. it was primarily adult women who did so, says lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body. though the fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects. courtesy shirley lindenbaum most of the world didn't know anyone lived in the highlands of papua new guinea until the 1930s, when australian gold prospectors surveying the area realized there were about a million people there. the epidemic likely started when one person in a fore village developed sporadic — the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. for one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place — the jekylls that can be so easily turned into hydes. the process was so odd that the process was so odd that some compared it to dr. jekyll's transformation to mr. hyde: "the same entity but in two manifestations — a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one." the case was closed after a group at the u.s. national institutes of health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. the group, which finally, after urging from researchers like lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. enlarge this image when shirley lindenbaum visited a south fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, "see how many children we have now?" he says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals. she also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades. finally, after urging from researchers like lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. they'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. according to according to michael alpers , a medical researcher at curtin university in australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. the so-called "prions," or "proteinaceous infectious particles," would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge. one leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalnature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. they can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk. "they ate what their mothers gave them," she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. but, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases. among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. the epidemic likely started when one person in a fore village developed sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru. it was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive. that's what researchers in north america, including belay, are trying to find out right now. " people have developed variant cjd after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease . they'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the "laughing death." one leading hypothesis, nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. first, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. but here's the bigger question, says belay: "how many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?" lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. the cdc is working with public health authorities in wyoming and colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease. "i have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru," he wrote in an email. in many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. women removed the brain, women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions. but, as with kuru, it will take years — maybe even decades — before he can know for sure. "unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission," says belay. "in early 2000, we had about three states that reported cwd in the wild in deer and elk. the disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. so in 1961, lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue. specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals. chronic wasting disease in north america is spreading fast," says belay. the group, which won a nobel prize for the findings, dubbed it a "slow virus." the disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. when researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. after ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. but it wasn't a virus — or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. but what about other prion diseases in other animals? could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? his team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. but women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. many locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. in some villages, there were almost no young women left. they called the disease kuru , which means "shivering" or "trembling." "and that, in itself, is good news for us," he says. after but what was causing it? it had to do with funerals. it was an act of love and grief. "then, they were told not to touch that stuff." but what was causing it? that answer eluded researchers for years. they fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. "snacks," says lindenbaum. today , that number is 21."

a handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. when considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it’s not which hand is dominant that matters—it’s the degree of dominance. they’ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they’re more likely to die young. from all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated. some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. according to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it’s more of a spectrum. scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. they seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people’s perspectives. we use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks. if you’re a lefty who enjoys feeling superior, we’re not going to tell you to tone it down. these experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. it seems we’ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left. they’ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. the left-handed brand has come a long way in the last few decades. have you got a big question you'd like us to answer? we associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. the majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of satan, alight with hellfire. other studies found no link at all. for all we know, you could be right. today’s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. does being left-handed really make you more creative? the answer to that is a definitive ... maybe. might not even be the right question. but are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? if so, let us know by emailing us at bigquestions@mentalfloss.com. are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? is there really a left-handed personality? are lefties really more creative? that depends on who you ask. but "are lefties different?" they may even sleep differently. but who knows? this is ever-changing, constantly evolving science.

consumers can try to avoid 1,4-dioxane by avoiding the following ingredients: peg, polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene and -eth- as such, sen. chuck schumer of new york is calling for the ingredient, which he claims causes eye, nose and throat irritation, to be removed from all personal care products in the us. the cancer-causing ingredient lurking in your beauty products: lawmakers are calling for a ban on a carcinogenic ingredient commonly found in body washes and lotions. luckily, schumer insists that 1,4-dioxane is relatively easy for brands to eradicate noting in a statement that "vacuum stripping" is a cost-effective way to remove it from personal care formulations. but despite that, it’s still found in a shocking 46 per cent of products and brands aren’t even required to list it on the label. found in everything from body washes to hand soaps and lotions, the environmental protection agency claims it is a likely carcinogen. a byproduct of other chemicals used in beauty products 1,4-dioxne can often escape your attention on the list of ingredients. when it comes to grooming, we slather and lather beauty products onto our skin in an effort to look better and smell fresher. chances are, once your products go down the drain you don’t stop and think about what could be in them. now, a new ingredient is coming under fire; 1,4-dioxane. what’s more, it has an ewg (environmental working group) score of 8, 10 being the most toxic. but what exactly is the true cost of our vanity? or maybe you did when microbeads – the small pieces of plastic in facial scrubs and makeup – made headlines last year.
the patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and "prebiotics" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. after a month of this regime, volunteers in an fmri study at ucla's school of medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that enterobacter helped cause obesity. turns out, m. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. when microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao). "bad guy" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. here's a taste... by jena pincott "you're taking the wrong chill pill" try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for b. animalis, s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus). "you struggle to burn off your muffin top" while the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). in a study led by liping zhao at shanghai jiao tong university, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called enterobacter in his gut. the surprising thing that may be making you crave junk food the 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out. "you found wisdom among the dahlias" a bacterium in soil called m. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in behavioural processes. "you really love a smooth grenache" good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. the problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the cleveland clinic. we inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? note: only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out tmao. "sorry, you have a high-steak problem" now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. one explanation: the good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. "a number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them," explains james scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the university of toronto. plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight. as it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. "your housemates influence you more than you think" ok, you don't like yogurt. after mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. very, very hungry" surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. a caveat: the benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota. they're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them. (for mice, the "superbrain" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) (but burger lovers, be heartened: scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.) but if your housemates eat them -- good news! while most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author kirsten tillisch, md, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers. so what can they tell you about yourself? their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other "friendly-flora" foods.

"we generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you’re not really responsive, that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased," says david hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. "roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing," says margaret campbell, a professor of nursing at wayne state university who has worked in palliative care for decades. during six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics—not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died. the "patients’ pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality," the researchers write in the journal of palliative medicine. when she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. for many dying people, "the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival," says david hovda, director of the ucla brain injury research center. jimo borjigin, a neuroscientist at the university of michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. my mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor’s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. now, americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. * * * in her last couple of weeks, when my mother’s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. for those who do die gradually, there’s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as "active dying." "if you’re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you’re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up," borjigin says. recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain’s response to dying. "as the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system," hovda explains. the rats’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it’s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. during this time, hallenbeck writes in palliative care perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. he compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: people tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills—and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. according to the centers for disease control’s most recent figures, americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. "they see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘realer than real.’" she realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. the way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. "the predominant quality of pre-death dreams/visions was a sense of personal meaning, which frequently carried emotional significance for the patient," they report. despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery. being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. * * * a week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. but that’s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. what it feels like to die "do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?" most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, campbell notes—and the medicine usually works. "we can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. "a lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain," she says. a month or two earlier, she’d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to australia with my father. in fact, researchers led by christopher kerr at a hospice center outside buffalo, new york, conducted a study of dying people’s dreams. "there are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there’s no distress." when people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. so, we thought, if you’re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. in fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn’t hurt. "pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness." while scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. james hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at stanford university, often compares dying to black holes. (patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) it was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. having a disease associated with pain doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. "if they’re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully," she says. seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. "the waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea." the researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death. once, i captured her hands in mine and asked what she’d been doing. my mother and i sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents’ colorado home. whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. but modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. as one passes the ‘event horizon,’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change." for most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. and those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. "you may or may not even be aware of what’s happening." "there are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable," campbell says. "suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized," she says. "and so that’s where people begin to see light." the sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. but what we felt most was a sense of relief. this half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. i wanted to know where her mind was. "these are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. the last senses to go are usually hearing and touch." i wanted to know what she was thinking about. they anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. they exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. for one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? still, we weren’t prepared for the nurse’s question. the neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. in fact, that was the case." my mother and i exchanged glances, a little shocked. what does dying feel like? "first hunger and then thirst are lost. speech is lost next, followed by vision. is her mind gone? "putting things away," she answered, smiling dreamily. there’s good reason.
on thursday, the state highway patrol posted this very clear message to their facebook page: the state highway patrol says it has "no plans to increase patrols on highways near the state line to look for those transporting marijuana into the state from colorado," but that the "bottom line" is that "any amount of marijuana in either dried or in plant form in the state of wyoming is illegal to possess." albany county sheriff dave o'malley told the laramie boomerang that his office expects to see more drivers under the influence of marijuana as well as drivers carrying pot out of colorado into wyoming. "we saw an impact just after the medical-marijuana legalization in colorado in the number of stoned drivers on (wyoming) highway 287," o’malley said to the newspaper. under colorado's marijuana law, it's illegal to transport marijuana outside of state lines and drive while under the influence. "we had more people in possession as well as people using while they’re driving. this state is not excited about legal weed yes, a lot of people are excited about colorado's new legal recreational marijuana laws. but don't count the wyoming highway patrol among them. so we’ve had an upswing in that regard."

my point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn donell have embraced donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the republican party and conservative media world. if donell trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told esquire in 1991: "it really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass." presented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the republican party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? some conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a donell trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. he routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on manhattan’s 5th avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent. f t in a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated president obama. meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model melania trump would make an ideal first lady slam michelle obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a maoist reeducation scheme. over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, "fat," "ugly" and "pigs"; he told one female journalist she had "the face of a dog." moreover, so much of donald trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. trump’s hesitance to condemn david duke, his "law and order" mantra evocative of richard nixon’s southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment. an intellectual, ivy league-educated, cool-tempered family man, obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-christ, a crypto-muslim manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy america. which brings us to the crux of the matter: whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in american society. a racial double standard exists at the core of the republican party and conservative media world. last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host — let’s call him donell trump — announced his candidacy for president of the united states. donell trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. once the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, donell trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. yet it’s far from hidden; it courses through the presidential campaign, as the notion of a donell trump candidacy clearly shows. the values donell trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president. but the closest the gop ever had to a black trump, 2012 contender herman cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public. or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and "baby daddy" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of african american absentee fatherhood? would rush limbaugh insist that donell trump’s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with african american ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a "thug." donell trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star. granted, if conservatives rejected donell trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong. a substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but donell trump has no apologies. he joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. if donald trump were black, would the gop base accept him? would bill o’reilly and jerry falwell jr. praise donell trump as a model american businessman and moral leader? or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of ebonics? " he’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. a notorious adulterer, donell trump has fathered five children with three different wives. his book "the end of europe" is forthcoming from yale university press. james kirchick is a fellow with the foreign policy initiative. donell trump can’t get enough of it. the answer is obvious. then there’s money.
52 percent of people said they don't add sweeteners, 14 percent of people use splenda, 7 percent of people use white sugar, 4 percent of people use stevia and 3 percent of people use simple/flavored syrup. and if you're worried about how much coffee is okay to consume -- you might be surprised by how much is "allowed" in one day. check out more of the zagat findings below and see how your coffee consumption compares: how much coffee does the average american drink? the new 2015 dietary guidelines the government just released say 3 to 5 cups of coffee are okay, as long as you don't add cream, milk or sugar. how much should we be drinking, and how much are americans actually drinking? this is how much coffee americans drinks every day coffee is one of life's greatest gifts. what kind of sweeteners do americans add to their coffee? read the rest of the findings here to learn more about american coffee consumption patterns. what kind of drink does the average american man order? what kind of drink does the average american woman order? how much do americans pay, on average, for a coffee drink? lattes (22 percent), followed by regular coffee (19 percent) and cappuccinos (12 percent). men go for regular coffee (30 percent) followed by espresso (14 percent). they just released the results from their third annual coffee study, which highlights consumers' coffee habits. not only does it help most people wake up in the morning, it also has a lot of health benefits. but how much do we know about coffee? 2.1 coffee drinks per day, and it increases with age. $3.28, higher than 2013 and 2014. luckily, the folks at zagat have some of the answers.
late last week, avalos and an unspecified group of other plaintiffs who say their photos were used to make phony accounts filed a $1.5 billion class-action suit against match.com’s parent company, iac (interactivecorp), in manhattan federal court, according to the post. that’s not because avalos is an online dating enthusiast — it’s because match.com allegedly allowed more than 200 fake profiles to post avalos’ pictures, according to the new york post. why this model is suing  for $1.5 billion "not a day goes by when someone doesn’t tell me that they saw my pictures posted on match.com or another [website],"  says miami model yuliana avalos. in 2011, a group of former match.com users filed a class-action lawsuit in dallas, alleging the site purposely misled users by allowing millions of fake or outdated profiles. a match.com representative told the huffington post that, "the real scam here is this meritless lawsuit, which is filled with outlandish conspiracy theories and clumsy fabrications in lieu of factual or legal basis. "the woman who he thought he was talking to was begging him for money and he finally went broke," she told the daily news. avalos told the new york daily news these phony profiles allegedly led to tragedy for one match.com user. the post notes the plaintiffs are seeking a court to mandate match.com monitor international ip addresses to prevent international users from creating domestic accounts. the case was later dismissed, and a dallas district court decided that match.com is not required to "police, vet, update website content." al circelli, a 70-year-old yonkers, n.y., resident, was reportedly fooled by a fake profile that used avalos’ modeling pictures. avalos said she was horrified when she discovered her face had played a role in the scam. according to avalos’ lawyer, these phony accounts are easily preventable with the right software, abc news reports. the company was previously sued for allowing phony match.com profiles. we’re confident that our legal system is as adept as we are at detecting scammers and will dismiss this case in short order." apparently, "aisha" told circelli she needed him to send her money to ghana. now, the part-time model is taking legal action. "he had to borrow money from his son. he was so ashamed that he killed himself." he went bankrupt. he lost everything.
still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the chilis’ crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as biffy’s or disclosure’s.the frontman doesn’t say much tonight - flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it’s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: "all these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare/ shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ i might have to do a wwe into that table full of drinks down there." and even if you truly can’t stand the red hot chili peppers, you’d still have a hard time arguing they were even the worst band on this stage – not when imagine dragons were the most recent occupants of it. it feels hypocritical to use the old ‘can x number of people really be wrong?’ argument in relation to this discussion, since fox news is the top-rated cable news network in the usa and it’s wrong literally all the fucking time. say what you will about the red hot chili peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as ‘under the bridge’ don’t deserve the scorn of fox news. the red hot chili peppers’ drummer is a 54 year-old man who’s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band’s resident badass. frusciante is still missed – keidis recently said of him that, "never did i meet someone who was so easy to write songs with" – but klinghoffer is making the role his own. the red hot chili peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven’t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. a useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they’re having more fun, him or the crowd. guess what the answer is.of the many, many former members of rhcp, you could argue that ex-guitarist john frusciante was – even more so than founding member hillel slovak – the only irreplaceable one. even so, it’s fair to say that songs like ‘dark necessities’ and ’go robot’ - both taken from the band’s new album, ‘the getaway’ - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight. at times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with flea’s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. there’s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe. are red hot chili peppers really 'the worst band in the universe'? look, it’s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. you might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed – unlike, say, set-closer ‘give it away’. this is a universe, after all, in which nickelback, limp bizkit and the pigeon detectives all exist on the same planet. yet josh klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling frusciante’s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. it’s a red hot chili peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. um, thanks for that, anthony.
susan rice, who’s currently the national security adviser, said she (and other women) had to shoulder their way into important conversations: "it’s not pleasant to have to appeal to a man to say, ‘include me in that meeting.’" and even when they’d made it into the room, female staffers were sometimes overlooked. obama’s female staffers came up with a genius strategy to make sure their voices were heard photo: pete souza/the white house when president obama first took office, the white house wasn’t exactly the friendliest place for female staffers. and came up with a system to make sure they were heard: female staffers adopted a meeting strategy they called "amplification": when a woman made a key point, other women would repeat it, giving credit to its author. most of obama’s senior staffers — such as former chief of staff rahm emanuel and former economic adviser lawrence summers — were men who’d worked on his campaign and subsequently filled his cabinet. "if you didn’t come in from the campaign, it was a tough circle to break into," anita dunn, who served as white house communications director until november 2009, told the washington post. this forced the men in the room to recognize the contribution — and denied them the chance to claim the idea as their own. as the post points out, things have gotten much better for female staffers in obama’s second term. obama noticed, she and others said, and began calling more often on women and junior aides. there’s an even gender split among his top aides, and half of all white house departments are headed by women. "it’s fair to say that there was a lot of testosterone flowing in those early days. it was an everyday thing," said one former obama aide who requested anonymity to speak frankly. "given the makeup of the campaign, there were just more men than women." "i think having a critical mass makes a difference," white house senior adviser valerie jarrett said. "we just started doing it, and made a purpose of doing it. now we have a little more estrogen that provides a counterbalance." so they banded together (shine theory!)
how beats tricks you into thinking it makes a premium product the sneaky designers at beats by dre employ a clever trick to make you think that the company’s plastic headphones are durable products worth the premium price. the crazy part is that the headphones are so cheap that beats actually needs to add weight to make them feel heftier. in these headphones, 30% of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight. one way to do this cheaply is to make some components out of metal in order to add weight. obviously, product designers use all sorts of aesthetic design cues to make things look fancier than they really are, but in this case, it’s downright deceptive. from the medium post: one of the great things about the solo headphones is how substantial they feel. on the right, four pieces of metal designed specifically to add weight to the product. amazingly, for all the company’s claims about precision sound design, the headphones use freaking off-the-shelf drivers! here is an image illustrating this point: on the left, all of the components that actually do something. a detailed teardown (via popmech) of a pair of beats’ immensely popular solo headphones conducted by hardware-focused venture capital firm bolt has some answers buried beneath. a little bit of weight makes the product feel solid, durable, and valuable. the cans are so dainty, beats felt the need to beef em up a little. the company cuts corners everywhere it can; gluing pieces together instead of using screws, and reducing the amount of tooling wherever possible. none of this is all that surprising because beats are, after all, terrible and fragile. sponsored i was not aware of this particular trick. it’s practically a perfect business: take crap and sell it for a fortune. i was not aware of this particular trick. in part it’s marketing, and you know, dr. dre. and yet they sell millions of pairs of headphones. how do they do it? beats by dre headphones are garbage. besides their crappy sound, they’re basically designed to break. the headphones are incredibly cheaply made. image courtesy of bolt. but there’s more. mostly though, it’s amusing.
if you've been procrastinating when it comes to raking, you're in luck: one homeowner recently shared the most genius trick for cleaning up leaves in a snap. this clever trick will instantly clear your lawn of unwanted leaves every year, there comes a time when our once-green lawns become completely covered in fallen leaves. as we watch shreves run up and down his lawn, quickly uncovering green grass with the cardboard, we can't decide whether to laugh or cheer. in the above viral video, which was posted to facebook by april medlen, brian shreves forgoes a rake for a giant piece of cardboard. shreves' viral leaf cleaning trick is sure to save a lot of people both time and money. ), but we can't believe we haven't thought of trying this before. we have to confess: this trick is simple (seriously—all you need is cardboard! he then uses it to clear his front yard of dead leaves in seconds.

he and his colleagues for solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or "staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some cheez whiz on a cracker," in solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. for solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or "staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some cheez whiz on a cracker," in solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. all the same, much of trump’s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers’ omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to sheldon solomon, a psychologist at skidmore college in saratoga springs, n.y. that includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. becker won a pulitzer prize for his 1973 book " solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. the participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly. the average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 3.8 points, but it was just 2.2 points for those who had been asked to think about pain. for example, solomon and florette cohen of the city university of new york, college of staten island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death. solomon said these results suggest that the fear of death is one of several interrelated psychological concepts that could help explain why trump has been so successful, including authoritarianism, an aversion to uncertainty and racial prejudice. "i’m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring," solomon said. this might be the darkest theory yet about why donald trump keeps winning on television and on the stump, at debates and in speeches, donald trump is reminding the american people that they are going to die. solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally. they showed that to be true during president george w. bush’s successful campaign for reelection against john f. kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004, and solomon’s new research with cohen has produced similar results for trump. then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. he and his colleagues have argued that the same is true of clothing and grooming, and that humans conceal their nature as animals from themselves to avoid thinking about their mortality. their inspiration has been the work of ernest becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. becker won a pulitzer prize for his 1973 book " the denial of death ," but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor. their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven’t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death. the other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration. this focus might be helping trump, since solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the college of staten island. another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist christians. a different group of researchers found that after a group of canadians read an article in which canadian cultural tropes were mocked, they were thinking about death, too. "it sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average american to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth," solomon said. one group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. they rated participants’ support for trump on a scale out of five points based on their answers to several questions. solomon and cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the college of staten island to respond to one of three prompts. yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. they solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. there was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study. "it was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof," solomon said. shown "c o f f _ _," for example, many people might write "coffee," especially students in college. those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. if they were thinking about death, however, they might write "coffin" instead. he and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation. "it is a factor, and in a very close election, it could matter." the reminders aren’t explicit, and they probably aren’t part of an intentional strategy. the pattern extends to religious beliefs.
the fbi announced this year that one of america's most baffling crimes — that of hijacker dan "db cooper" who jumped out of a plane with a parachute and ransom money 45 years ago — looks set to remain an enigma. the curious cases and unsolved #mysteries that perplexed us in #2016 from the tromp family's bizarre road trip to the bangladeshi boy who looks like an old man — the mysterious news stories of 2016 prove truth can be stranger than fiction. "the lights happened right on the peak of the shaking ... [and were] of colours mainly green and blue and white, but a bit of yellow and other colour was there too [sic]," said the uploader of one video, zachary bell. this year it was reported that doctors were at a loss to explain the mysterious illness making a four-year-old bangladeshi boy look like an old man. in august this year, mark and jacoba tromp and their adult children ella, riana and mitchell left their home in silvan, east of melbourne, taking cash but leaving behind bank cards and mobile phones. the family's car was later pulled over in wangaratta, after police received a report it was following another car, and a man, believed to be mark, ran away into a nearby park. when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck near christchurch in november, videos emerged that appeared to show the new zealand sky lighting up in blue and green. but somewhere along the way, he jumped from the back of the plane with a parachute and the money. reports of lights occurring during earthquakes date back thousands of years, with similar accounts also emerging after the christchurch earthquake in 2011. one day later he left the family trip at bathurst, describing his parents as scared, paranoid and worried they were being followed. during the flight, db cooper gave a flight attendant a note indicating he had a bomb in his briefcase. hundreds of kangaroos were found dead in far west new south wales this year from what was described as a "mystery disease". ella and mitchell spoke to the media, saying their disappearance was "hard to explain" and referred to the situation as a "family matter". the search for the family came to an end when mark was found on a street near wangaratta airport in "good health". people who said they witnessed the sky light up said it occurred at the peak of the earthquake. cooper gave the flight attendant a glimpse of wires and red-coloured sticks inside his case, the fbi said. meanwhile, mitchell and ella had made their way back to victoria to find police at their home. at the time, one police officer described it as "the most bizarre case in 30 years". a paper published in science journal seismological research letters hypothesised that the phenomenon was a result of positive charge generated along stress gradients that "accumulate at the surface". he asked her to write a note and take it to the plane's captain, demanding parachutes and $us200,000. the fbi said after one of the longest and most exhaustive probes in its history, it would no longer actively investigate the case. doctors at a top hospital in the capital dhaka agreed to try to diagnose and treat bayezid shikdar for free after learning of his plight. the symptoms are similar to those suffered by hollywood actor brad pitt's character in the film the curious case of benjamin button. their mother jacoba was found the next day in yass — where she too was assessed for stress-related concerns. the case, which made headlines around the world, remains a mystery, but theories have included drugs, financial troubles, mental illness and "shared delusions". bayezid was born with excess skin hanging from his limbs and face, and also suffers from related heart, vision and hearing problems. once the plan had landed in seattle, he exchanged the flight's 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. "all the work we've done says it's not a plant poisoning and it's certainly not starvation," he said. the two girls left their parents at goulburn, where riana was hospitalised with stress-related issues. "it's possible it's an infectious disease process, but so far we haven't been able to pinpoint that." as they drove towards nsw, mitchell's phone was thrown out the car window. there were sightings of between 5-50 dead kangaroos at a time. former nsw department of primary industry veterinarian greg curran suggested those figures indicated there were between 100-500 dead in any particular area. high-density accumulations of charged atoms are thought to ionise pockets of air which form light-emitting plasma. despite there being good feed and plenty of water around, something undetectable was knocking the roos off. doctors initially suspected he suffered from progeria, which causes rapid and premature ageing shortly after birth. with several crew members still on board, he ordered the plane to fly to mexico city. here are some of the most baffling tales. police found the house unlocked, with paperwork everywhere. nothing was heard from him ever again.
image of a telemarketing call center via mike vargas, 44-year-old from washington dc served 14 years for a drug conspiracy released from custody in 2009 it wasn't hard getting a job when i came home, it just wasn't a good job. you work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. image of cattle ranchers via wikimedia creative commons mendoor smith, 43-year-old from iowa served 12 years for marijuana possession released from custody in 2013 the worst job i had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a herculean task. the fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. i've had four jobs since i've been out, and i never told anyone i was on parole until after i was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. after serving 23 years in the feds, the first job i got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. david hibdon, 55-year-old from missouri served 10 years for drug conspiracy released from custody in 2014 my first job out of prison was the worst job available in colombia, missouri. i dreaded that job, but as i've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, i now consider myself lucky. ex-cons remember their worst jobs after being released from prison getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . i had to be there from about 6 am to 5 pm every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house i was placed in. you had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. after about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. but most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. but even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. that job sucked, but i was still glad to have it because i wouldn't be in the position i'm in today otherwise. i had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 pm, with only a short lunch break in between. i remember calving one shift during the winter, and when i did my hourly inspection of the herd, i noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. the work sucked, and i was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. i started working the same week i was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. i had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. and all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke k2 all day while i was working. most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through "work-release." it wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. they asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what i did to get all that time. i was making about 50 bucks a day, but i was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. with my first paycheck, i bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. i called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. it served its purpose because if you don't have a gig you have to stay at the halfway. often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. vice chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison. the halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and i had to walk there every morning. i wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. one dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. according to the national institute of justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release. i had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. it was cool at first, but after a while i was starting to feel like a robot. he was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job i have now. when i did my final inspection of the morning at 10 am, the cow had died. i was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. there are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between. i worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. you had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. it was one of the most degrading experiences i ever went through, but i got past it. i could go back to the dump if i wanted, but that job sucked. it sure didn't help me become a better person cause i was still the same after. having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. no one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. i've done a lot of different things, but that was the worst. that said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. it's easier and the pay is better, but i am always looking for something better. it took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car. he helped me get my class a driver's license so i could drive trucks for him. there was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course. if you went to get a coke, you had to clock out. anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. the farm was a tight-knit family, so i was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. i worked there because it was the only job available. i've had like seven or eight jobs since then. i'm a machinist now, and i assemble parts all day at a machine. if you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. it was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. dealing with cows everyday is messy, and i'd have to clean out their living pens. i quit that job when i had something better lined up. i eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. if you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. it prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. some days i walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. it didn't kill me and it made me stronger. i had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating. if i bought a soda or cigarettes i was almost broke. my boss was a good boss. dudes would curse out the boss. all that work was for nothing. i was alienated out there. he walked out shortly after.
verizon and at&amp;t don't like this internet ruling, but your pocketbook will verizon and at&t don't like this internet ruling, but your pocketbook will a seemingly obscure legal decision was reached this week, but it affects our use and enjoyment of the internet, and ensures that we won't be charged more for it. it was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay. they've wanted to offer different classes of internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay. net neutrality means that the internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the fcc, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. but for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers comcast, verizon, and at&t. it’s the way the internet has worked since its inception and we know how the internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. they want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access. when comedian john oliver explained on hbo’s "last week tonight" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes. it’s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined. next page: how the citizens beat the lobbyists, and what this decision means for you. the internet association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. four million citizens emailed and called the fcc objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. the decision upheld the federal communications commission's (fcc) regulation that supports net neutrality. opposition also came from the major technology companies such as amazon, google, facebook, and netflix.
i remember when i finally graduated high school... it was one of the biggest milestones in my life but, as i’m sure you can relate, it was also a very bittersweet moment. jp is part of lapeer high school’s class of 2016 and he gave his peers some closure to their high school story by doing something that they would never forget. on one hand, i was finally moving on to the next, incredibly exciting stage of my life: college! his song speaks to their time in high school, how they’ve grown and affected each other’s lives. he acknowledges that they would inevitably drift apart but he makes a promise that he will never forget the memories that they’ve made together. but it’s not long before you realize that jp has actually changed the lyrics to speak directly to his fellow graduates. but on the other hand, friends and acquaintances were all going our separate ways and it was time to say farewell. jp begins with 7 years’ familiar lyrics, telling the story of his mother’s advice about making friends. jp got on stage and sang his very own special rendition of lukas graham’s hit song "7 years." jp’s powerful message could be felt across the room, and you can even see tears in people’s eyes. it certainly wasn’t easy to come to terms with this very emotional time. instead of a graduation speech, this teen does this and surprises everyone! but meet 18-year-old jp wallace. and it was spectacular. what an incredibly touching moment!
of course, i am referring to the infamous blue harvest, which was the name that was used during production of return of the jedi — and a name that will always be etched in the minds of star wars fanatics everywhere. star wars: episode vi – return of the jedi highly regarded as one of the best films of all time, star wars: episode vi – return of the jedi is a pop culture classic. not much has been revealed about the next film in the historic franchise, but it seems a leak of the potential title has given us plenty of cause for speculation. in a video that seems to show some kind of star wars celebration, an apparent poster depicts episode viii to have the title fall of the resistance. whether this is the actual title or a working title is a mystery in itself, but episode viii already has a working title, according to carrie fisher — space bear: episode viii. however, i don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set. star wars: episode vii – fall of the resistance (possibly) the apparent leaked title of the next installment is fall of the resistance. while the title the phantom menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. 'star wars: episode 8' working titled leaked the first big bit of information regarding star wars: episode viii has slipped onto the internet! and this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for episode ii was episode ii: jar jar's big/great adventure. it was so popular that family guy titled the first part of its star wars trilogy after episode vi's working title. episode ii – attack of the clones brought us the lovable ewan mcgregor as obi-wan kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in jar jar binks. each one is unique and shows just how fascinating it must be to be a part of the on-set moviemaking magic. pretty adorable, and the whole crew seems to really be having a great time working on episode viii. star wars: episode vii – the force awakens the force awakens was easily one of the most anticipated films of all time. star wars: episode ii – attack of the clones this is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. personally, i liked this title much more than the phantom menace and i think they should have stuck with it. it was titled after j.j. abrams' production company and was referred to as episode vii: foodles. with each star wars temporary name, there are some funny ones and definitely some weird ones. pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. if this is truly the title, we will definitely be in for an interesting storyline. star wars: episode i – the phantom menace ahh, episode i, how hyped you were. the backlash would have been insurmountable and i don't think it would have every recovered from that. episode viii to have the title fall of the resistance. check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years. unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. fisher tweeted out a photo of her adorable dog sitting on a chair with this supposed headline. a bit adolescent i know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless. so what is your favorite star wars working title? the original was episode i: the beginning. indeed, star wars has a long history of doing this. could you imagine if lucasfilm actually ran with this? but that is beside the point. no, this is not a joke. #spacebear2017! #hailjarjar!
we've finally figured out when the moon formed the cataclysmic collision between earth and a mars-size object that forged the moon may have occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, suggests a study of meteorites with ancient fragments from that cosmic impact. if future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, "possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like osiris-rex, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy," bottke said. this finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself. the simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. "we can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era," bottke said. "to understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era," bottke said. this research "raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial earth or moon-forming impactor called theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites," bottke said. [how earth's moon was made (a photo timeline)] "by understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of earth," study lead author william bottke, a planetary scientist at the southwest research institute in boulder, colorado, told space.com. finding these materials would be one of the holy grails of geology — we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet." they found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of earth's mass — away from earth and the moon. collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact. "investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. the leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. the ages of the most ancient lunar samples the apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts. "in a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history," bottke said. "by reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it." the researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates. one of those was the young earth, and the other was a potentially mars-size object called theia. "in an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected," bottke said. these collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said. to find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. earth was born about 4.5 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward. "this gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now." however, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. "it may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. the scientists detailed their findings in the april 17 issue of the journal science. here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids." the moon then coalesced from the rubble.
anyone over the age of 18 caught with 10 grams or less of the drug will no longer have to make a court appearance and will not have offenses entered into their permanent record; instead, violators will have to pay a fine of 100 swiss francs (approximately $110), then be on their way. a 2013 unicef report found swiss children are the world's second-most likely to smoke marijuana, with just over 24 percent of 11, 13 and 15-year-olds having smoked pot in the last year. for perspective, canada leads the world in kids' marijuana use, with 28 percent of its children aged 11, 13, and 15 admitting to smoking pot in the past 12 months. per the independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. penalties are now stricter for anyone caught selling to a person under the age of 18. another country decriminalizes marijuana as of oct. 1, possession of marijuana is decriminalized in switzerland. lawmakers in the country relaxed weed regulations in an effort to unify what had been a patchwork of often confusing policies that varied from one local area to another. but "decriminalized" is not the same as "legal," as a swiss broadcasting corporation report makes clear. the new law also provides greater resources to help children with marijuana habits. growing marijuana plants, imbibing the drug in any form and dealing it are still forbidden. it will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents.

john gruber, a well-regarded apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for apple's second-tier phone: it’s just that instead of putting the year-old iphone 5 in slot #2, they’ve created the 5c to debut in that slot. same a6, same camera, same just about everything — except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... what changes with the 5c is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that apple can promote apart from the flagship 5s. since 2010, apple's media blitz for its new iphone has gone like this: on a friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, the verge points out. if you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for apple. the iphone 5c number apple doesn't want you to know on monday, apple managed to make a bit of news by not announcing any. for the first time, the iphone maker didn't reveal how many preorders were made on its new line of smartphones. here's a new one released on monday: for now, apple will keep plugging away at the 5c. with investors interpreting apple's silence as weak initial 5c sales, apple's stock slid to $450 on monday from friday's close of $465. the silence on orders for the iphone 5c -- a week after it was announced -- has investors down on the tech giant. the company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales. as many others have pointed out, the iphone 5c is essentially a rebranded iphone 5 with nearly all the same specs. for one, apple's top-line phone, the iphone 5s, can't be preordered. by the time the iphone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million. but this year, apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iphone 5c preorders went live. with android-run smartphones made by samsung and google cutting into apple's market share, many see the global appetite for apple smartphones waning. but preorder numbers for iphone 5c, even if they are low, may not be the best indication. by creating the perception of scarcity, apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iphone. a few days later, apple trumpets the high number of new iphones the public wants. here's a new one released on monday: for now, apple will keep plugging away at the 5c. but circumstances may be a bit different this year. the 5c is, effectively, an iphone 5. in 2010, more than 600,000 iphone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. this didn't go unnoticed by wall street.
knowing her daughter’s love for dancing and playing, she decided to take some of her old pennies and glue them to the bottom of her daughter’s play shoes, and the results were amazing. however, just because they may be as good as obsolete in a monetary sense, there are still a lot of things that pennies can be used for with the help of a little creativity. the reason for this is not only that pennies are the lowest denomination, but that people don’t want to use pennies anymore. it actually costs more for the united states to produce a new penny than a penny is worth, meaning they are literal black holes of value. creative mothers like this one will always find a way to bring a little extra joy to their children with whatever means they have at their disposal. these repositories are nice to collect our coins in one place, but more often than not, pennies tend to dominate the bulk of the volume. you might think the sound would be overwhelming, but it was actually quite pleasant to both her and her daughter. the shoes were transformed into make-shift tap shoes, giving her daughter an extra level of excitement during her play time. i thought it was weird she glued pennies to her daughter’s shoes, but when i found out why? it wasn’t too different from the sound of actual tap shoes. a lot of people have large change jars somewhere in their home. that’s exactly what one mom did with her spare pennies. more parents should take a cue from this nurturing woman. genius!
rick snyder (r-michigan) will shut down a secret fund that paid salaries to his trusted advisors, living expenses for detroit's emergency manager, and new furniture and security for the governor's residences, one of his spokepersons confirmed to the huffington post. nerd is "fundamentally involved in remaking the form and purposes of state government, and the interests who benefit from that financially would certainly have an interest in supporting it financially," rich robinson, head of the michigan campaign finance network, told the detroit free press. "given the financial straits of the city, the limited resources of the state, and the very big and challenging job that kevyn was hired to do, it was deemed appropriate and necessary to help save taxpayer dollars," wurfel said. but she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and "all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely." but there's been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 irs return obtained by the detroit free press. the "nerd" fund, an acronym for "new energy to reinvent and diversify fund," is a nonprofit, but all the donors' names have been kept anonymous from the public. snyder should keep his promises of transparency and immediately disclose which corporate special interests are backing the nerd fund," lon johnson, michigan democratic party chair, added in a statement sent to the huffington post. "shutting down this slush fund in an attempt to avoid transparency only raises more red flags," said michigan state afl-cio president karla swift in a statement sent to the huffington post. he left both positions in june 2012 for another government job: a $115,000-a-year position as the investment administrator for the michigan treasury department (which manages cities and school districts in financial emergencies). the condo is rented at a price of $4,200 per month; the fund also paid for travel expenses for orr to see his family, which resides in maryland. he was paid $48,366 for 10 hours of weekly work as assistant secretary and treasurer of the nerd fund (the 501 (c)4's only paid employee of 2011.) wurfel told the detroit free press that one of the fund's stated purposes is to offset the cost of governance. paying for the upscale condo rented at the westin book cadillac by detroit emergency manager kevyn orr, as well as other expenses of orr's. "the function and purposed of the fund is essential to continued reinvention efforts, saving taxpayer dollars, and helping ensure responsive, accessible government," wurfel said. she confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations "will go far above and beyond what the law requires" -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details. baird, a snyder adviser who was the architect of the governor's successful campaign team, retired as a global partner from pricewaterhousecoopers. many wonder whether donors or special interest groups contributed to the fund in secret have received any favoritism from the governor's office. sara wurfel, a spokeswoman for snyder, told the huffington post that the fund had "had simply become an unnecessary distraction." $130,638 spent on a security system and new furniture for the state-owned residences used by gov. "there’s an independent board that does that work," snyder said under oath, according to the detroit news. but the fund has become one of the biggest controversies in the michigan governor's tenure. snyder still has a solid lead over gubernatorial opponent mark schauer in the 2014 election, according to a recent poll published by mirs. snyder will make the names of donors to the nerd fund public. snyder was the sole client of the consulting firm run by rich baird, who gov. baird was appointed a state employee on wednesday, according to the detroit news. she also defended snyder's need for the fund to subsidize additional government expenses. rich dibartolomeo was snyder's deputy campaign manager and director of finance. at the same time, he was also collecting a salary from gov. snyder calls his "transformation manager," according to the detroit news. snyder, according to the detroit free press. in 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $1.3 million. he will take home an annual salary of $140,000. snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities. there's still no word on whether gov. $100,000 in consulting fees to mi partners llc. snyder's campaign committee, according to citizensforethics.org. orr's salary is $275,000. gop governor pressured to reveal secret donors gov. how was the nerd fund money spent? a new website, secretivesnyder.com, asks, "when will snyder come clean?"

this riff in response to republican criticism of how obama describes the threat posed by the islamic state militant group, which is also known as isis and isil, captures his view on perception politics nicely: for a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against isil is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase "radical islam." so if someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who we're fighting, if there's anyone out there who thinks we're confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield. and that's because it speaks to obama's unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on "how it looks" and/or "how it will play." ...there has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn’t use the label "radical islam." the first was that the advocate, a louisiana newspaper chain, the first was that the advocate, a louisiana newspaper chain, published an editorial calling on the president to come to the state to see the horrible flooding first-hand. if he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actually is stupid — he won't do it. if he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actuallyisstupid — he won't do it. the i-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to obama. ( the i-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to obama. and he's angry because in obama's mind the sort of performance-for-the-sake-of-performance that republicans are demanding is everything that's wrong with politics. that's why obama won't break off his vacation in martha's vineyard — or stop playing golf on said vacation — to travel to louisiana. the second thing that happened was the second thing that happened was this tweet obama playing golf at martha's vineyard with larry david today — manu raju (@mkraju) — manu raju (@mkraju) august 18, 2016 cue outrage. and that the sole reason to go to louisiana is for the theatrical piece of politics, a piece that he not only rejects but detests. not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. and, and, as has been documented ad nauseam , there's really no such thing as a vacation for a president of the united states. "presidents don’t get vacations — they just get a change of scenery," nancy reagan famously told critics of her husband's regular trips to the family's ranch. (nota bene: for all of you "all he does is perform" readers, i know that is a view of obama that many people hold. he's genuinely angry — not an emotion you see all that much from any politician at that level but particularly the usually calm and professorial obama. his stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the affordable care act badly hamstrung his party's attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law. in 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing president george w. bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of hurricane katrina. but we don’t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. george w. bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in crawford, tex. president obama won't end his vacation for one specific reason president obama reacts after putting on the first green. it read, in part: we’ve seen this story before in louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel. because he believes he can monitor the situation as well — or better — from where he is. it’s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering americans. his unwillingness to say the words "radical islamic terror" have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and republican presidential nominee donald trump. that’s the key, they tell us — we can’t beat isil unless we call them "radical islamists." sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. the current president was among those making political hay out of bush’s aloofness. but this piece is about how obama thinks of himself . (manuel balce ceneta/ap) two important things happened today in the political world of president obama. is there a military strategy that is served by this? would it make isil less committed to trying to kill americans? ( bush once took a five-week break during the summer of 2005 .) not how you or i think of him. obama has long been a rejectionist on this front. what exactly would using this label accomplish? obama just doesn't like to fake it. what exactly would it change? would it bring in more allies? and so on and so forth. i am not blind to it. now back to our regularly scheduled programming.) still, it's worth noting this moment. the answer is none of the above. this is a political distraction... work, especially in this digital age, follows you around. not once. tough stuff, right?
"we are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors," he said. us surge according to immigration new zealand, in november 2016 when the us presidential election was held, 17,584 people registered their interest to study, work or invest in the country, compared with 1,272 in november 2015. the revelation that mr thiel had quietly become a new zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment. mr thiel, who previously said new zealand was a "utopia" and has invested heavily there, is just one of several us migrants who have realised what the country has to offer. "what we are experiencing at the moment is a slight increase in visas issued to american nationals, both temporary work visas and permanent resident visas," steve mcgill, general manager at immigration new zealand, told the bbc. "we've definitely had an increase in american inquiries, and at least one sale that has been a direct run-off from the presidential result in the united states," says nick horton, an agent specialising in luxury real estate. "they are from all over the united states and are educated, looking to either work in new zealand or invest if they have a considerable amount of capital behind them." but mr mcgill said opposition to wealthy investors, who can secure a residency visa by spending a minimum amount in the country, was not a major issue. "there's just a feeling that people want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere that's away from some of the problems facing the western world," he says. forget bunkers in the forest full of food tins and bottled water - it seems new zealand, with a population of 4.4 million, has become the best option for a new breed of american survivalist. when the new zealand herald revealed this week that silicon valley tech billionaire peter thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldn't have been a surprise. in the two days following the election, the agency said its website received 88,353 visits from the united states - compared to a usual daily average of 2,300 visits a day. sarah coombes-crome, an immigration consultant, said that traffic to her firm's website was up approximately 600% the day after donald trump won the election and has remained higher than average. "it's a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means new zealand is a pretty attractive place," mr mcgill said. "the same happened after the global financial crisis, and the same thing happened after obama was elected, when some people thought the united states wouldn't tolerate having a black leader." between october and december last year, 348 residency visas were granted to people from the united states, compared with 338 in the same period in 2015. the temperate, mountainous country is also comparably well-placed to deal with rising sea levels, and its most recent major attack was in 1985, when french spies blew up a greenpeace vessel in auckland harbour. "i was talking to someone out of san diego this morning and he's looking to invest potentially tens of millions of dollars in new zealand. chris whelan, the chief executive of the wellington regional economic development agency, says the country offers plenty of career opportunities, but with a much better lifestyle that you would find elsewhere. "for him it's got excellent skills, excellent talent, and what was previous a boundary (distance)... with modern technology you're connected to the world all the time. transparency international ranks it as the world's least corrupt country, and the 2016 global peace index said it was the fourth safest behind iceland, denmark and austria. what we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities. chance the rapper says he wants to move there and tech billionaire peter thiel has become a citizen. it's also very easy to buy a property or do business in new zealand, you can move your money around freely." the west coast of the united states is a 13-hour flight away, and modern technology has tamed the tyranny of distance. punching above its weight new zealand recently overtook singapore as the best place to do business, according to the world bank. "i am aware of the recent commentary around mr thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in. registrations have remained higher than average, with 3,159 received this month, compared to 1,724 in january 2016. "it's a country with a similar land mass to britain but with 4.4 million people." it detailed the rise in wealthy investors who see new zealand as their escape from a volatile world. "they are both english speaking countries, they think similar, they have the same values and similar religious beliefs. better lifestyle it isn't just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to new zealand. wellington-based journalist ben collins asks whether new zealand is becoming a "utopia" for americans looking to leave. however, as horton explains, the interest from the united states is not new. "i think new zealand and the united states are very similar," she said. "we have had a pretty active strategy of identifying investors out of america over the past few years. work visas rose from 2,296 to 2,699 over the same period. recently, the new yorker magazine ran a piece titled doomsday prep for the super-rich. however, registrations are far higher than actual visa applications. it is safe and clean. the last utopia?
well this is one way to get flawless skin whether working behind the scenes or in front of the camera, huffpost live producer lauren mikler's makeup always looks so darn perfect. then lauren blends the foundation and adds the darker shade to the spots where the sun would hit like the cheeks, temples and chin (another tip she picked up from her mother). however, it takes more than just a single swipe of face makeup for her to get flawless skin. she lets it sit for a few minutes on the areas that need a little more coverage. to achieve a streak-free finish, lauren applies a lighter shade as a base to cover up flaws. "i have two foundations that i put on every day," lauren told us. (she saw huffpost live lead makeup artist kari bauce do this trick.) this adds a whole new meaning to looking "lit from within." it's because i layered on two foundations.' and i'm like, 'no, it's not. people always say, 'your skin is so smooth.' she's the one who got me started. (right now her current fave is revlon super lustrous lipstick in love that red.) we can always expect her to be sporting an amazing lip color. but it's not really thick." "my mom used to do it.
what makes the announcement so great is that unlike some tech companies that provide great perks for already highly paid people in silicon valley, the majority of the 125 employees at boxed are paid hourly and handle shipping and fulfillment. this company pays for employees' weddings and their kids' college some companies, especially in the digital space, are doing amazing things to attract and keep employees. this was in addition to last year’s announcement that the company would cover the costs for employees’ kids to attend college. boxed, an online costco-like retailer, just announced that the company will pay for employee weddings (up to $20,000). from extended paid maternity leave to free gourmet lunches, companies are thinking up creative ways to make a great work environment and lure talented people. boxed ceo chieh huang told the huffington post that "free snacks get old, i just want to do the stuff that really matters." he went on to add that real things like weddings and college are much more important than snacks and ping pong tables. so these types of perks really are life-changing for their employees. there’s now a new company making waves for introducing some pretty amazing perks. oh and on top of these two crazy perks, all employees get unlimited sick and vacation time. they are also hiring for a wide range of jobs right now. wow!
the president of pennsylvania state university, eric barron, claimed that breitbart’s milo is creating an "anti-free speech movement," adding that the university "dodged a serious bullet" when they canceled his talk. barron’s speech was part of the university’s ‘all in’ campaign, designed to promote diversity and inclusion on campus, suggesting ideas such as "specially-designated diversity-related courses" to increase "understanding of social justice and equity in the u.s," as well as diversity training for the university’s police force. discussing the riots that took place at uc berkeley in protest of milo’s event, barron said that penn state had "dodged a serious bullet" in that milo’s event was canceled. "he’s creating his own anti-free speech movement wherever he goes because his message really is, tear down the university, they’re just a bunch of liberals that don’t want to listen to anybody," barron continued. this week, legislators announced a tennessee bill to protect freedom of speech on college campuses, known as "the milo bill" in recognition of his contribution to promoting the first amendment. one of the key objectives of milo’s tour was the promotion of free speech on typically censorious american college campuses. just a slight flaw with this argument... he went on to claim that protesters are generally not students, but organized by "anti-fascist anarchist groups" who follow "white supremacists speakers and the milo’s of the world." after both parties failed to reach a contractual agreement.
of the 120 foods the researchers looked at, four turned out to significantly raise people's arsenic levels: beer, white wine (and to a lesser extent, red wine), brussels sprouts and dark-meat fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines, according to the study, published last week (nov. 16) in the nutrition journal. [5 things you should know about arsenic] in the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the epa limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. what's lurking in your white wine will scare you white wine, beer and brussels sprouts can be major sources of the toxic metal arsenic in people's diets, according to a new study. the results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said. people who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink. people who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month. the study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, cottingham said. however, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author kathryn cottingham, researcher at dartmouth college in new hampshire. researchers analyzed the diets of 852 people in new hampshire, and the levels of arsenic in their toenails, which show long-term exposure to the chemical. the new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods. "the mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption," cottingham said. it is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, cottingham said. the environmental protection agency (epa) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. but in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels. "probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day." the researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. [7 ways alcohol affects your health] one possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. and lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic. long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said. however, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the epa's limits. the arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. the most significant source of arsenic in most people's diets is drinking water. although some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, cottingham said. water is something we are drinking and using every day," cottingham said. "so knowing what your water exposure is, i think, is a big piece of the puzzle." "if someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. it's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. the element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment.
u.s. and uk regulators are expected to announce a civil settlement as soon as thursday of their investigations into jpmorgan chase & co's "london whale" derivatives loss, a source familiar with the matter said on wednesday. the settlement, which is expected to be for at least $700 million, would resolve several civil probes into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at the largest u.s. bank last year. regulators, including the u.s. securities and exchange commission and the uk's financial conduct authority, are expected to be part of the settlement. two former bank employees - javier martin-artajo and julien grout - have already been charged with trying to hide some of those losses by deliberately giving inaccurate values to the sophisticated securities involved in the trades. following the "whale" scandal, chief executive jamie dimon faced a bruising battle with some shareholders to retain his chairman title and has since been under pressure to improve the bank's relationship with regulators. the bank is facing separate probes by various government agencies into areas that include possible bribery in hiring practices in china and potentially fraudulent sales of mortgage securities. bruno iksil, the trader whose large bets earned him the nickname "london whale," has signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors and has not been charged with any wrongdoing. a settlement would mark a key step in jpmorgan's efforts to resolve its regulatory and legal troubles. however, u.s. prosecutors are still investigating jpmorgan for potential criminal wrongdoing. the new york times reported that the fines would top $900 million. how much will jpmorgan pay for 'london whale' losses? the fca and sec declined to comment.
but critics say mylan has little incentive to improve epipens: "if you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — i don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate," said nicholson price, an assistant professor at the university of michigan law school who studies health care regulation and patent law. the company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an epipen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack. "it’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the fda," stepanian added. mylan, which owns the epipen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is "investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life." the same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis. "if you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment," said matthew allen, head of drug delivery for cambridge consultants. windgap’s device is meant to improve upon the epipen: it’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated. it doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps in the wake of the recent outrage at mylan, los angeles-based mannkind corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine. there’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis chris stepanian is ceo of windgap medical, a boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years. the regulatory process is slow and expensive a lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said mark baum, ceo of san diego-based imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the epipen. stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: "it’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product," he said. a representative from kaleo said that it’s "in the process of evaluating when and how" to bring the auvi-q back to the market — but sanofi is no longer involved. "it’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that i’ve looked at it closely — until i had to start paying all this money," clark said. "we could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an epipen or auto-injector by far," mannkind ceo matthew pfeffer said. 5 reasons why no one has built a better epipen oston mom denise clark has been buying epipens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. but though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the epipen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines. though epipens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs. the very fact that the epipen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. "the only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this," baum said. they’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital. imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it. it’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s. though epipen components look pretty basic, mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. but it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler. but they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on mylan’s patent. "but when the market was more normalized — when the epipen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk." one epipen alternative that did make it to market: the auvi-q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. granted, the federal trade commission has been fielding complaints about mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret. but mylan has a lock on the particular epipen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust. it can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get fda approval for a new product. stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market. the devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two epipens now lists for $608. mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025 epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. public anger at epipen is so high right now that baum figures it is worth taking the risk. he said the food and drug administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. mannkind already has an inhalable insulin product, called afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. the public hasn’t spoken (loud enough) denise clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with boston medtech advisors. but it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap. (mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.) "it would not be very difficult to create an epipen product, in terms of engineering," allen said. "at least mylan and pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one." problem is, he won’t carry his epipen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket. it returned the commercial and marketing rights to kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. but sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. and more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product. their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. that means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation. allen’s work at cambridge consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. "i guess mylan’s motto is, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’" clark said. but since the epipen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. "they have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the epipen?" she helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy. "epipen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug," price said. "we’re just focused on being that competition," he said. competitors have tried to make runs at the epipen. "you just have to know how to use it." but that’s proving easier said than done. "it’s large and it’s impractical," clark said. it’s purely the patent that stops us." and they’re not so user-friendly. "where’s he going to put it?" this underscores a simple truth: epipens just aren’t that great. they expire after about a year. but they’re also bulky. they’re reliable, sure. "it’s not rocket science. 5. here’s why: 1. sales have been far below expectations. 2. those rules keep consumers safe. 4. 3.
in a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why: as all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. "but, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner," said moderator chris wallace. as jefferson would later write , the "revolution of 1800" was a big deal: [it was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. here's what donald trump rejects when he undermines the election results in what immediately became the headline moment at the third and final presidential debate on wednesday night, republican candidate donald trump sparked widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation "in suspense" about whether he will accept the results of the election next month. i want to say that one of the great features of america is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... as time's david von drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from al gore to george w. bush was a long time in coming not because gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. however, i have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...i know too that many who are listening in the eastern part of the united states will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... but, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated john f kennedy had won. south carolina seceded from the union that december, declaring that the north was "united in the election of a man to the high office of president of the united states whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery." "not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country." as he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required: almost a century and a half ago, senator stephen douglas told abraham lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. in fact, when it became clear what the result would be, gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. i want senator kennedy to know, and i want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next president, he will have my whole-hearted support. this principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise. well, in that same spirit, i say to president-elect bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may god bless his stewardship of this country. rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that "public opinion at the north has invested a great political error" and that south carolina would not go along with the outcome. in 1860, after abraham lincoln was elected, stephen douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by gore, as he conceded the result. but, even before the election took place, the south had already warned the nation that a victory by lincoln and the republican party would be unacceptable in their eyes. but while adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test. it was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead jefferson became president and his rivals—the incumbent adams as well as burr—accepted the result. the nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election. indeed, the nation's ability to regularly and peacefully replace the president was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the american experiment. as john adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was "the sublimest thing ever exhibited in america." in 1800, on the other hand , the united states saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. the result was close, and it also left thomas jefferson and aaron burr tied, with the house spending a week deciding who would be president. yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy. after all, george washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and adams kept power within the same party. for example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that richard nixon should have won. (at the time, the vice president was whoever came in second.) the rest of the confederacy would soon follow south carolina's lead. that doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. i'm with you, mr. president, and god bless you.'' neither he nor i anticipated this long and difficult road. certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. (in fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) that tradition even held true in 2000. by april, the civil war had begun.

she then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: "i have never had a better experience at a club than i did then...the lgbt community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when i, uh, learned something about myself." in 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains the lgbtq community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as lgbtq or straight supporters who want to help the cause. you may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think wanda sykes and zachary quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn’t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. 15 lgbtq celebrities you didn’t know came out in 2016 the lgbtq community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as lgbtq or straight supporters who want to help the cause. owen released a music video for his song "can’t fight it" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. 7 gloria vanderbilt famed and respected news journalist for cnn, anderson cooper, has been out as a gay man since 2012, but earlier this year he was thrown for a loop when his own mother, gloria vanderbilt, dropped some bombshell information. we are going to name 15 lgbtq celebrities you didn’t know came out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. 6 nur warsame nur warsame is an imam in australia, and for those of you who don’t know an imam is an islamic worship or mosque leader in the muslim faith. there have been a number of mosques in australia that will not accept warsame through its doors, while other muslim leaders have spoken out against warsame and said that his acceptance of his sexuality is wrong. the 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his american idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very "androgynous and masculine" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. in the video, dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn’t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. nur warsame is an imam in australia, and for those of you who don’t know an imam is an islamic worship or mosque leader in the muslim faith. taking to social media, haynes commented on a tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about haynes’ "secret gay past," and that it got them "so excited." when writing on a guest blog post for huffpost healthy living, ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. it was a piece of information that had been unknown to cooper for his entire life, and the way the journalist reacted was downright adorable, as he shrugged his shoulders at his mom and said, "what? we should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. the whole thing was quite touching, and in fact, vanderbilt wrote a book with her son which was recently published entitled the rainbow comes and goes: a mother and son on life, love, and loss. beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is "comfortable enough to say it" and "can finally breathe." the singer also took to the twitterverse and tweeted: "i’m so happy i’m gay" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. just two years ago, stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, michael angarano. 15 kristen stewart actress kristen stewart was the other half to actor robert pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in hollywood in the past. ewing plays the role of dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. the 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the mtv series teen wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. a few months ago, beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that’s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. as for cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said "make america gay again." there are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift. in "can’t fight it," owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something’s up. the 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant alicia cargile, and before that, stewart was dating soko, french actress and musician. stewart and cargile have only been dating since july of 2016, but stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. warsame came out at the start of the summer in 2016 and became the first imam in australia to openly identify as gay. vanderbilt spoke during a joint interview alongside cooper and revealed that when she was a teenager, she had a lesbian relationship with one of her classmates. in 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. wilson then pointed out the kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one’s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. mother and son shared a cute giggle together and cooper seemed grateful to know that his own mother had experimented with her sexuality. it is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. so take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community. many people have assumed that this was haynes’ way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn’t say he was gay directly. on the other hand, there have been other leaders and people in the public who have commended warsame for his actions. while she doesn’t identify as an lgbtq individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida, that she tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. plus, the other guy in the video was played by shane bitney crone, a pivotal advocate and public figure in the lgbtq community. he hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they’re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. she then blatantly stated that she falls in love "with girls and guys," and that she can’t help it. 11 reid ewing if the name reid ewing sounds familiar, that’s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit tv series modern family. so it was with mara wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as matilda and miracle on 34th street. plaza plays the perfect cynical debbie downer character, but the 32-year-old actress’ unique and distinguishable character traits aren’t the only thing that makes her special. plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender "isn’t a factor" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. and i know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way," dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual. he takes the man’s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. more and more states in america are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. 8 rayvon owen some of you may remember rayvon owen from american idol’s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. the actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don’t identify as either. he is now an advocate for other muslims who may be struggling with their own sexuality.' his tweet read: "saw eugene bata on @gma in the body dysmorphia segment connected to my article i just want to say he is hot af." the 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. the 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar youtube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. yet in early 2016, stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual. 13 mara wilson sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. a few months ago, dawson released a youtube video on his channel simply titled "i’m bisexual." plaza’s revelation came during an interview with the advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. by the end of the music video, owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. 10 shane dawson for years, youtube sensation and funny guy shane dawson was suspected of being gay. haynes then responded to the tumblr post, writing "was it a secret? 14 aubrey plaza who didn’t love watching aubrey plaza play andy’s (chris pratt’s) girlfriend april on parks and recreation? 9 ryan beatty another celeb who came out in 2016 was singer ryan beatty. plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people’s gaydar. 12 colton haynes actor colton haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. he would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. warsame was previously married to a woman and he also has a young daughter. stating that, "i don’t know who i am 100 percent. naturally, warsame has dealt with an outpouring or both support and hate. feel free to share the list on social media! are there any names on this list that really surprised you? *drops mic* that’s the way to do it! his instagram post included the words "raging homosexual" and "gay power." the announcement came right before the release of his single, "passion." someone commented and asked "did

setting the date for may 5 pic.twitter.com/cfrfpgsbcd — chris brown (@chrisbrown) february 22, 2014 brown, who assaulted his then-girlfriend rihanna in 2009, has continued to make waves in recent months. brown, who assaulted his then-girlfriend rihanna in 2009, has continued to make waves in recent months. chris brown has big plans for 2014 after months of hype and numerous delays, chris brown's next album finally has a release date. brown took to twitter to make the "x" announcement, calling the project "my best album yet." "x" is by far my best album yet.... the performer announced this weekend that his sixth studio album, "x," will hit stores on may 5. his most successful releases to date were his first two albums, 2005's "chris brown" and 2007's "exclusive." 1 on the billboard 200 but did not reach the sales levels of some of his earlier albums. the 24-year-old singer dropped his last album, "fortune," in 2012. he is currently being sued following a physical altercation last fall and has been spending time in a treatment facility. the record hit no. both were certified multi-platinum.
as much as she loves her boyfriend, leslie wants to achieve her own success away from the gossip-mongers who feed off her high-profile relationship, which means working on individual projects and carving out a career on her own accord. and it looks as though harington kept the fate of jon snow under wraps with his beloved, divulging that she was unaware he'd return to the show following his shock death at the end of series five. ygritte kicked the bucket after being shot by a child with a bow and arrow, and died in jon snow's (harington) arms, whilst poor snowy was left for dead after being stabbed multiple times. the 29-year-old redhead had the pleasure of acting as ygritte alongside her scraggly-haired beau – who has captured the hearts of many a teenage fangirl – during her stint in hit television series, game of thrones. the writers are being incredibly loyal to the books and the way it's developed jon snow needs to be on his own and take charge of his own life. working and spending each day with your partner can be challenging at the best of times, but we never predicted that kit harington's girlfriend would have such thoughts. whilst the majority of human kind would be more than happy to spend every living hour with harington, she's decided she has better things to do. rose leslie doesn't want to work with game of thrones beau kit harington again is there trouble in paradise? "i think it's important to do your own projects that mean a lot to you individually, rather than be associated with someone else. it was during her 17 episodes on the show that she became snow's love interest, both on and off screen. it's not as if the lovebirds really had the choice of working together on gotagain, as both of their on-screen alter egos were killed off. she said: "i had no idea...i was kind of like, just as surprised as the rest of the world when the man woke back up again." despite bagging one of the most sought-after hunks on the small screen, rose leslie has pledged to never work with her love again. insisting she wouldn't like to see her character brought back from the dead, she continued: "i'm now a little pile of ash. though "ecstatic" about his reappearance, she claimed she is "going to have words" with him for being so shady about the new season six. we had such a fabulous time working together on thrones. i think it's a good thing that she died." i'm a big believer in doing your own thing," she added. leslie told the evening standard: "i think we leave it at that. watch game of thrones on sky atlantic on monday (16 may) at 9pm. trouble in paradise? grim viewing, to say the least.
it feels nice that i have been chosen having these scars on my face." "there are so many beautiful girls, i never thought i would be chosen because of my scars." she's also working to be a champion for young women in her situation. the doctors have done a great job recovering her lips, and chantelle tries to fight against feeling self conscious. after all she's been through, she can't quite believe her current life situation. in fact, she's even joining beauty pageants to help her confidence. her thug boyfriend scarred her for life, the way she responded took guts. "i didn't think a beauty pageant would want someone like me. here, she's seen collecting a prize for the top model of england competition. but this story isn't about him: it's about chantelle, who is recovering beautifully. it proves you don't need to be a perfect person. clearly, chantelle doesn't have any problems winning, despite her perceived flaws. for starters, she had major plastic surgery to repair her injuries.
about forty minutes later, she dropped this bombshell: and for all the cynics out there, guthrie said she set her wedding date before she found out she was having a baby. the blushing bride celebrated her nuptials to mike feldman by—what else?—tweeting about it: she also shared the news on "today," saying, "it was beautiful; just everything i could have dreamed." 'today' anchor makes not one but two huge announcements savannah guthrie announced on monday morning that she got married over the weekend. then, for good measure, she announced she was four months pregnant. so, what did you do this morning? but guthrie wasn't done.
after learning she didn't have long to live, she composed a dating profile for the man she'd leave behind i have been trying to write this for a while, but the morphine and lack of juicy cheeseburgers (what has it been now, five weeks without real food?) as the couple head home in the early morning of sept. 6, somehow through the foggy shock of it all, they make the connection that today, the day they learned what had been festering, is also the day they would have officially kicked off their empty-nestering. after a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening’s meal. i have never been on tinder, bumble or eharmony, but i’m going to create a general profile for jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days. if he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale, it’s not too far off, except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half decades of playing house together. this is a man who, because he is always up early, surprises me every sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot: a spoon, a mug, a banana. i am wrapping this up on valentine’s day, and the most genuine, non-vase-oriented gift i can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds jason, and another love story begins. he also has an affinity for tiny things: taster spoons, little jars, a mini-sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench, which he presented to me as a reminder of how our family began. a few hours and tests later, the doctor clarifies that the unusual pain the wife is feeling on her right side isn’t the no-biggie appendicitis they suspected but rather ovarian cancer. those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. in my most recent memoir (written entirely before my diagnosis), i invited readers to send in suggestions for matching tattoos, the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink. i would call him an artist except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown office most days from 9 to 5. let me explain: my father’s best friend since summer camp, "uncle" john, had known jason and me separately our whole lives, but jason and i had never met. i should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else. when i moved back home to chicago, john — who thought jason and i were perfect for each other — set us up on a blind date. but when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, i thought, "uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person." i need to say this (and say it right) while i have a) your attention, and b) a pulse. this is when we entered what i came to think of as plan "be," existing only in the present. if you’re looking for a dreamy, let’s-go-for-it travel companion, jason is your man. this was based on an essay in the book where i mention that "more" was my first spoken word (true). this was my second tattoo; the first is a small, lowercase "j" that has been on my ankle for 25 years. when i was working on my first memoir, i kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon. this is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says, "give me your palm." i’ll leave this intentional empty space below as a way of giving you two the fresh start you deserve. still, i have to stick with it, because i’m facing a deadline, in this case, a pressing one. here is the kind of man jason is: he showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flowers. additionally, the intermittent micronaps that keep whisking me away midsentence are clearly not propelling my work forward as quickly as i would like. a husband and wife walk into the emergency room in the late evening on sept. 5, 2015. i probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. the following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way. she would say, "i’d like to see more of this character." with all my love, amy with all my love, amy with all my love, amy get lifestyle news from the style, travel and food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use. a few weeks after publication in august, i heard from a 62-year-old librarian in milwaukee named paulette. i got mine on the underside of my left forearm, in my daughter’s handwriting. i have been married to the most extraordinary man for 26 years. as for the future, allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article, jason brian rosenthal. jason loves listening to live music; it’s our favorite thing to do together. by the end of dinner, i knew i wanted to marry him. i’m going to miss looking at that face of his. if our home could speak, it would add that jason is uncannily handy. i was totally serious about this and encouraged submitters to be serious as well. i went to college out east and took my first job in california. but it was funny because she could have just said: "jason. i was planning on at least another 26 together. and now it may very well be my last (time shall tell). the youngest of their three children had just left for college. or at least it did before i got sick. in september, paulette drove down to meet me at a chicago tattoo parlor. no wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar. he is an easy man to fall in love with. go ahead and ask him; he’ll tell you. my guess is you know enough about him now. first, the basics: he is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes. but that is not going to happen. i want more time with my children. you can probably guess what it stands for. she got hers (her very first) on her left wrist. (he knows i love all the flavors but white.) of course, i would agree — he was indeed a captivating character. jason has one too, but with more letters: "akr." on the subject of food — man, can he cook. i want more time sipping martinis at the green mill jazz club on thursday nights. no trip with my husband and parents to south africa. jason is compassionate — and he can flip a pancake. i did it in one day. and the part about me getting cancer. did i mention that he is incredibly handsome? let’s add more about jason." i want more time with jason. no writers’ residencies at those wonderful schools in india, vancouver, jakarta. i had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. but they are, admittedly, a bit of trippy fun. no reason, now, to apply for the harvard loeb fellowship. she suggested the word "more." he knew a year later. he is fit and enjoys keeping in shape. he is an absolutely wonderful father. so why i am doing this? no dream tour of asia with my mother. see that guy on the corner? want to hear a sick joke? have drained my energy and interfered with whatever prose prowess remains. so let’s swipe right. we were only 24. our young adult sons, justin and miles, often borrow his clothes. he is a sharp dresser. so many plans instantly went poof. i love his artwork. it was 1989. and, voilà, a colorful gumball appears. ask anyone. hundreds poured in. jason paints. jason? blech. wait.

a week ago, news broke of the first publicized player to have a week ago, news broke of the first publicized player to have caught all the pokémon in pokémon go , but the news was reported with a catch. that being said, we have every reason to believe you can find mew in pokémon go — that is if you’re in guyana. well, people have searched through the coding of the actual game and found the six pokémon in question are embedded in the game’s data. the idea that mew is somewhere in a jungle in guyana not only falls in line with its history but also current patterns in the game. the other six (ditto, moltres, articuno, zapdos, mew and mewtwo) have not been located at all, which begs two questions: are they even available? in those games, upon reaching cinnabar island, players have to navigate their ways through the pokémon mansion, a burned mansion where a pokémon researcher used to live. they are only 142 pokémon available in the us, nine short of the 151 featured in the original television series. this genius pokémon go theory may have just revealed where you can find mew you and 3.1m others like this. but there’s very tangible evidence indicating the answer to where mew may be, and all it requires is a millennial trip down memory lane. the second question is a bit trickier; where articuno, zapdos, moltres, ditto and mewtwo are is anyone’s guess. pokemon red pokémon go is no stranger to placing pokémon in specific habitats. you’re much more likely to catch a magikarp or a goldeen near the hudson river, for instance, than you are to catch them in your bedroom. and the game has already shown it can go to great lengths to place a pokémon exclusively where it "belongs." the first pokémon games our generation truly fell in love with were the red and blue versions for the game boy. there’s a specific journal in pokémon mansion that a player can read. the first question is the easiest to answer — yes, the missing six are out there somewhere. there’s no doubt kangaskhan is available in australia because of its kangaroo-like features. in that journal lies the entry detailing the origins of a mysterious pokémon. pokemon red the records clearly state the mysterious pokémon was named mew. mime, kangaskhan and farfetch’d) are only available outside the us. you and 3.1m others like this. if so, where are they? three of the nine (mr. here’s a video illustrating that point. how do we know? for example.
his idiosyncratic 9,000-square-foot northern virginia home, however -- heavy on the shark tanks, and also featuring an outdoor pool, seven bedrooms, 10 baths, that personal grotto and then some more shark tanks -- remains. arenas, now playing ball in china (working, fittingly, for the shanghai sharks), once said that feeding the sharks kept in the tanks costs some $5,000 per month. the house, located at 10919 georgetown pike, great falls, va., went on the market in june 2012 for $3.5 million, but was taken off some six months later. former nba star gilbert arenas, whose shoe-pooping incident is not the most colorful event in his past, left the d.c. area at the end of 2010. whoa eccentric basketball player is selling his very bizarre home multiple shark tanks, a personal grotto and a half-million dollar drop in price will make this someone's dream house. it was re-listed this july for same price; then $250,000 was shaved off in august. and, hey, if you do buy this big house, that extra $500,000 might come in handy. another $252,000 came off at the beginning of september.
instead of having to look at one empty seat all week, the group of friends decided to take matters into their own hands, and find a new joe mcgrath to take with them. this guy went on a holiday with a group of total strangers for the greatest reason for nathan’s birthday, nine of his friends planned a trip to majorca. he wrote: although i had my doubt if the offer was legit, i decided to take the plunge as my legendary boss gave me the time off work. he wrote: would you consider coming on holiday with a group of nine strangers if they had already arranged flights for you and an all inclusive hotel? i drove down to bristol on saturday night and had a mad three days with complete strangers that i think i can all my good friends. they asked 15 namesakes, but only this one said yes: @gralambo they asked 15 joe mcgraths and i was the only mad enough joe to say yes!!! so this happened pic.twitter.com/99mqxdzvyw mcgrath wrote on facebook that he doubted the legitimacy of the offer at first. it’s our friend nathan’s 30th birthday and we decided to throw him a surprise holiday break in mallorca. one of the group messaged some joe mcgraths on facebook. i want to apologise to my mum who thought i knew these people all along. but unfortunately one of them, joe mcgrath, bailed. what a mega group of people! i loved every minute of it.
"never-before-seen photos behind the scenes at the women’s march" — washington post while the exact long-term impact of the women’s march in january remains to be seen, the event introduced ideas of what modern-day feminism looks like, in terms of scale, coverage and inclusivity. "this is what international women’s day looked like around the world" — buzzfeed news on wednesday, women across the world marked international women’s day by marching for various women’s rights, including health care, immigration, freedom from sexual violence, and equal pay. "8 portraits of refugees that will help you understand the refugee experience" — buzzfeed news this portraits series is beautiful, and the faces only begin to hint at the poignancy of the subject’s stories. this roundup of images is testament to the incredible power of intercommunication in the digital age, when a woman on one side of the globe can raise her voice in unison with her sisters on the other. kisha bari’s images feel instantly iconic, and will undoubtedly be added to the catalog of feminist history for being one of the few photographers to cover the making of such a large-scale protest. by doing so, de vries encapsulated the message of the story in her portraits: the impact that music has had in the lives of these children. "mozart in nairobi’s korogocho slum" — al jazeera the most striking thing in this photo essay is how eva de vries placed the children with their instruments in the middle of the slum. 9 incredible photo stories you absolutely can’t miss here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the web. "honest photos of motherhood challenge what we think of as natural" — huffington post in leah devun’s exploration of motherhood, she focused on apparatuses that aid women in performing the very maternal act of nursing their offspring. although the edit is concise, the scale and breadth of coverage is impressive, showing the impact that the oil industry has across canada and the continental united states. there’s something deeply troubling about these pictures, and while i can’t exactly put my thumb on it, the collection constitutes a great example of creativity in young photographers today. in this collection of still lifes on vice’s creators, photographer ambera wellmann whimsically plays with these emotions by creating a photo project best described as uncomfortable. i hope brandon hill continues this work — it’s all the more relevant as a nation of immigrants begins to grapple with the future of that legacy. "these extremely uncomfortable photographs are guaranteed to make you squirm" — vice a good photograph can evoke a strong visceral reaction from the viewer. "21 of the most powerful photos of this week" — buzzfeed news 9. but the women photograph website proves otherwise, breaking misconceptions and showing that women also belong in areas of war and conflict. they don’t hold back in showing the viewer what it really takes to care for a child after birth. "21 of the most powerful photos of this week" — buzzfeed news "a crude awakening" — time time should be applauded for taking a sweeping 360-degree look at the effects of the proposed keystone and dakota access pipelines. devun also shows that there’s nothing wrong or unnatural with using technology to help with breastfeeding.

the srinivasan family left and right: courtesy of the srinivasan family the three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the u.s. for the srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off. the emanuels would go on to become the stuff of legend and are often called the jewish kennedys: bioethicist zeke is a vice provost at the university of pennsylvania, a former obama administration official and one of the main architects of the affordable care act; rahm is the mayor of chicago and a former chief of staff to president obama; and ari created william morris endeavor, one of the biggest talent agencies in hollywood. their upbringing was stricter than their friends’: the kids weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn’t go to a friend’s home unless their mother nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. "it’s never like, ‘oh, this person is so important, i can’t challenge him.’" the wojcicki family left: courtesy of the wojcicki family; right: cody pickens for time esther had begun her daughters’ ed­ucation long before they were peppering stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles. the gay family left: courtesy of the gay family; right: cindy hegger photography awareness of the im­migrant experience, compounded by the fact that the gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. the rodriguez family left and right: courtesy of the rodriguez family this is a story about nine american families with children, like the rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. the nine families also included parents who were elementary-school teachers, a preschool painting instructor, a doctor who taught medical students, a former french teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history. they’re unlike many of the other eight families: their parents aren’t immigrants or educators, nobody in their family cared much about politics, and they didn’t break rules, because there weren’t any rules to break. the dungey family left and right: courtesy of the dungey family for the srinivasans, having a parent who was an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that was almost as powerful as familial love. "she would draw lines of faces, like three happy faces and one sad face, three triangles and one square, and then there’s my little crayon marks marking the one that was wrong," recalls channing, who learned to read when she was 2 years old. a free-range childhood like many of the other siblings in this story, tan and maya lin grew up on a university campus, were raised by immigrant parents and bickered constantly over board games. but many of these siblings said they regularly fought with their brothers and sisters over everything from clothing to board games to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trips. roxane gay is a best-selling author and new york times opinion writer, joel gay is one of the youngest black ceos ever to helm a publicly traded company (energy recovery), and michael gay jr. is a civil engineer. they immediately start mocking anne for bringing her own kale to breakfast, mimicking janet’s high school cheerleading routine (anne knows it by heart) and passing around a video of anne dancing in a hula skirt on a family vacation. in selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like venus and serena williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the trumps or the kennedys). five-year-old susan was often left to babysit 4-year-old janet and infant anne, and local mothers raised their eyebrows when the girls rode their bikes alone to the dime store a mile away. "i made sure that given how close i came to dying, that i was never, ever going to not get the most out of everything i was doing," he says. lessons in mortality jack and rachel antonoff can’t describe their childhood without discussing the third antonoff: their younger sister sarah, who died of a brain tumor when she was 13. she did arts and crafts projects with her toddler daughters, took them to the library every week and taught them how to read, count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom. "you probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don’t want to disappoint your teachers in the same way you don’t want to disappoint your parents," says sri. as rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the south side of chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl’s ear as she slept: "i can and i will." "she was a supporter of us, but she didn’t tell us what to do, and she allowed us to play and develop our own ideas," says zeke of his mother. and so the lin parents, who fled mao and ultimately became professors at ohio university, didn’t monitor their children’s homework or force them to join sports teams or push them to learn the piano. susan is now the ceo of youtube, janet is a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the uni­versity of california, san francisco, and anne is a co-founder and the ceo of genetics company 23andme. she let her kids skip school, she didn’t insist they finish college, and she took jack to get his lip pierced at age 15, to the shock and dismay of other mothers in the grocery store. video by diane tsai for time not all days were great—the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. abc entertainment group president channing dungey is the first black president of a major television network, and her sister merrin dungey is a well-known actor, with major roles on once upon a time and alias. while none of the parents held high political office, their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil rights to union organizing to demanding that cities build new parks or that universities treat low-wage workers fairly. the lin family left and right: courtesy of the lin family the lin siblings spent most of their time outside, or writing poems, or throwing clay in the university ceramics studio. that meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the kansas jayhawks in a living room adorned with indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate "krishmas," their version of christmas. "the core was, we’ve had a sick kid, we’ve had a kid who’s died, so let’s get real about what’s important here," shira says. between their mother’s civil rights work, their pediatrician father’s campaign against lead paint and their grandfather’s union loyalties, the three rowdy youngsters couldn’t escape political awareness even if they tried. "if we did not go with her to a particular protest, that protest was brought home," rahm recalls, sitting in the briefing room of the chicago mayor’s office. and though few openly admit it, sibling rivalry can motivate achievement, says new york university psychologist ben dattner: "winning the nobel prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother." few of the siblings in this story had parents who closely monitored their movements, and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friends. they stood with him on picket lines and visited his class on radical politics, and they were watching when he lay down in front of a bulldozer to protest a segregated construction site. video by diane tsai for time that political engagement created a sense that the world was malleable and that the boys, through their actions, could be the ones to shape it. esther wojcicki taught her daughters to swim as soon as they could walk, specifically so that she wouldn’t have to watch them when they played near the backyard pool. "we made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community," saroja recalls. "i have to get my gallbladder out, and i don’t want to do it until this record is done in case i die on the table," he says. instead, since their sister’s death more than a decade ago, the antonoffs say they’re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality. "it’s not that it will change necessarily, but the world can change, and that you have a responsibility to try to make a change." and between stan’s academic universe and esther’s educational parenting, another commonality emerges: seven of the nine families had a parent who was a teacher. many of them were outspoken in their demands for reform in cities, schools and housing complexes, and never just for the benefit of their own children. of course, developmental experts have now proved esther right: the first few years of a child’s life are among the most important for learning and brain development. their daughters susan, janet and anne would interrogate the guests about theoretical physics when they weren’t busy passing hors d’oeuvres or throwing each other in the pool. but the three daughters of puerto rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. "when you hear about a movie coming out that you’re excited to see, do you not think every time, oh, i hope i’m still alive?" esther wojcicki says she found out about her daughters’ secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet. the srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. their mother had been an elementary-school teacher before channing was born, and she applied her classroom skills to raising her two daughters in sacramento. when they show up for breakfast in their childhood home on stanford’s campus, each wears a shirt that belongs to one of the others. their father henry huan lin had been forced to take calligraphy classes while growing up in china, an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy. "because we grew up with a lot of strong academics, i think one of the skills we have is not being intimidated," says susan. her older sister srija put it this way: "if i took $20, that meant sri and srinija couldn’t go to the movies." of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. they went to a high school with an open-module system, which meant that sometimes they went to class only two days a week. immigrant drive as gino rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in chicago, saroja srinivasan, a hindu who is vegetarian, was mastering the art of the hamburger. "one time danny took a comb and ran it through my hair, and it hurt real bad," says the youngest brother, joseph, known as rev run. the emanuel family left: courtesy of the emanuel family; right: brooke collins—city of chicago daniel simmons sr. also found himself arrested during civil rights demonstrations. and srinija is an entrepreneur who was one of the first employees at yahoo and now sits on the board of stanford university. "he promised that when he had kids, they would never have to do anything they didn’t want to do," maya says. and yet while the antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most, many of the other eight families also experienced a brush with untimely death. "we were given all sorts of freedom to do whatever we wanted," recalls tan, now a poet and the author of a dozen books. jack and rachel’s mother shira antonoff said sarah’s death drowned out all the petty judgments and expectations of their suburban new jersey community. political activism on most nights, the three emanuel boys would adjourn their ritual fistfight and flop on their mother’s bed to hear a story. "the more you do for your kids, the less they do for themselves, and the less empowered they feel," she says. but each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, "today is going to be a great day. "we were called a lot of bad names, and we had to withstand that and continue to go on," says zeke emanuel. after working as a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s, she began to suspect that early-childhood education was more crucial than anyone then thought. he knew what was right and what was fair, and he demanded that kind of justice," says russell simmons of his father. instead, the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive, grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths. but russell is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur, a co-founder of def jam recordings and the chairman and ceo of rush communications. here’s what they have in common every night for 20 years, gino rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters’ beds and whispered an incantation. he worked as a new york city school-attendance superintendent by day and taught a college course on black history by night. we talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, jews from chicago and indians from kansas and haitians from nebraska. controlled chaos another thing the simmons brothers had in common with the emanuels: they knew how to throw a punch. but sometimes she didn’t come home: marsha emanuel was occasionally arrested as she demonstrated against segregation in 1960s chicago. the simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. growing up in heroin-ridden hollis, queens, in the 1970s, danny and russell once survived a street fight against 12 other guys. the simmons family left: courtesy of the simmons family; right: anthony behar—sipa press/ap some of the rowdy behavior sounds like normal, run-of-the-mill mischief. maya, an artist and architect who designed the vietnam veterans ­memorial, puts it this way: "they were the anti–dragon parents." parent-teachers on another university campus, far from the srinivasans in kansas, esther wojcicki was having a pool party. they didn’t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids. now adults, they say their father’s activism showed them how to get involved in the world outside themselves. but even outside hollis, some of the families (especially those with boys) recalled a household dynamic that resembled a fight club. they threw paper airplanes during presentations, hurled small objects off hotel balconies and even came up with an elaborate fashion-consulting prank to trick academics into changing their ugly ties. their children recalled early supplementary lessons, books read aloud, regular ­library trips and even at-home worksheets to give them an early boost in school. danny is a painter and author who co-created def poetry jam on hbo with russell and oversees the rush philanthropic arts foundation. "i empowered them early, because i wanted to make sure they could take care of themselves," she says. six-year-old zeke emanuel regularly escorted 4-year-old rahm home from nursery school on a chicago city bus. here’s what they have in common nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. her husband stan was chair of the physics department at stanford, and they regularly hosted barbecues for students and their families. his young sons remember waving goodbye as he boarded a bus from queens to see martin luther king jr. at the march on washington in 1963. just like their neighbors, the three srinivasan children—sri, srija and ­srinija—played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. parents in these families instinctively under­stood the importance of at-home instruction decades before researchers established the merits of early education. after spending weeks in the hospital battling that life-threatening infection, rahm says, he transformed from a slacker student into a go-getter. each of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead. joel gay recalls that his wife was on the verge of tears when she first had dinner with his family. sri would grow up to sit on the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. not all taught at the university level, though three families had at least one professor as a parent. rahm emanuel nearly died as a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection. that’s why i can and i will are five words without an object, a push without direction. adds joel: "the more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one’s work ethic is." "they were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere," says roxane. on their school vacations, the girls were usually dragged to physics conferences, where they would torment the world-­famous scientists. they grew up in controlled chaos: heavy on conflict, light on manners and indifferent to standards of appropriate behavior. zeke emanuel puts it this way: "if there wasn’t blood, it was a good night." it wasn’t just that they fought; it was that they fought and then moved on. "seeing tragedy always pushes you to move past it," says danny, the oldest, who beat heroin addiction decades ago. video by diane tsai for time not all kids from tough neighbor­hoods make it out. "on the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance," says srinija. srija is the interim deputy chief for the san mateo county health system, responsible for public-health efforts affecting more than 700,000 californians. the woman who was shot in the head in front of the rodriguezes’ home was their cousin. "you’ve got to find a path in life that you’re really happy with." we talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. even by the comparatively lax stan­dards of the 1970s, the wojcicki girls had more freedom than most. rebecca rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. in addition to puerto rico and india, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from israel, haiti, poland and china. with a few notable exceptions, most described a sibling dynamic that was wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst. for others, the bad behavior was a symptom of their willingness to make mistakes, an anti-­perfectionism that hardened into resilience. "if you don’t under­stand haitian culture, you can think we’re actually fighting." across the nine families, there were incidents of teenage parenthood, smoking pot, underage drinking, cutting school, bar fights, shoplifting and drag racing. jack is a grammy-winning musician who is the lead singer of bleachers and lead guitarist of fun., now on hiatus. they occasionally woke up during their father’s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. the simmons brothers grew up closer to raw, systemic violence than most families in this story. thousands of extraordinary families flourish across america, and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more. for some of these siblings, growing up in a constant state of trial-by-­combat made them tougher. they had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. susan and janet wojcicki loved to trick a young anne into approaching strangers and calling them "fat." but the academic environment also instilled a comfort with complex ideas and a confidence in asking questions. and most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did. no one received a gold star from "general gay and his attaché, nicole," as joel calls them. but none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children. and one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. srinivasan settled in lawrence, kans., with their three small children in the early 1970s, when t.p. "so he never really hid us from the stuff that was right on our corner." "we never went to preschool, because we didn’t have to," merrin adds. most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. and rev run was one-third of the hip-hop trio run-d.m.c. it may be that the job itself was less important than the educational mind-set. while none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. when they weren’t pushing for reform, they were mediating heated political debates at home. "you could, by protesting or coming up with ideas, actually change the world. one lin sibling designed the vietnam veterans memorial; the other has written 12 books. he says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created "an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself." they committed all the venial sins of american teenagers, and some of the cardinal ones as well. for many kids and even adults, a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation, not motivation. ("i just buy three of everything," says anne, universally acknowledged as the best shopper of the bunch.) on those nights, the boys bickered over the top bunk while marsha waited behind bars. they bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quinceañeras. "my theory was that the most important years were 0 to 5," she says. but we set out to find the ways they are the same. roxane and joel gay pushed their baby brother michael down the stairs in a laundry basket. being from haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. "when you have three girls together, it was already a party," janet says. "everything backs up to the amount of work i do before i die. "he respected what you learned in the culture in the street," says russell. but they didn’t have chores in the same way their friends did. the antonoff family left: courtesy of the antonoff family; right: amy lombard posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept. they learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. we looked for families in which all the siblings did well. instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. the gay siblings, a haitian-american trio, grew up in nebraska. circuit; his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the supreme court. and we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. nine families raised children who all went on to extraordinary success. at least two had parties when their parents weren’t home. political activism was a common theme for the parents in these families. "you cannot reach a goal unless you set that goal for yourself." you’ve got to reach your own goal," says gino rodriguez. rachel asks, sitting in the los angeles studio where jack is recording his latest album. their father didn’t try to shield his sons from all violence. the dungey sisters rode all over sacramento on their bikes alone. "good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about." and gina rodriguez won a best actress golden globe for her starring role on jane the virgin. they weren’t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. the dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. in the srinivasan household, less was required—but more was expected. ivelisse rodriguez simon graduated from harvard business school and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. by the standards of today’s helicopter parents, they ran wild. "she didn’t even worry too much whether they were safe or not." "i’ve only ever chafed when there are rules," maya says. i think that’s a very important message," says zeke. for their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen. the simmons brothers saw friends and neighbors killed by drugs, aids and gang violence. many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. in the 1980s and ’90s and is now an ordained minister and reality-­tv star. they could do math early, so they could handle money." many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. gina rodriguez once put glue in her sister rebecca’s milk. the message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep. you don’t talk to the conscious," rodriguez says. joined the math department at the university of kansas. they were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted. the antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted. the girls slept "hot-dog style," cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. there was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. you could say it was the opposite of helicopter parenting. "we lived the idea of the american dream," gina says. but other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. the wojcicki sisters became scientists, ceos and tech entrepreneurs. "they could read early, so they could read signs. it can also help a family get their priorities straight. "and they made an environment where that was possible." "she said, ‘i have never seen anything like that. why are you screaming at each other?’" he remembers. (the brothers also have a much younger, adopted sister, shoshana.) it stuck by all my brothers as well. "there was just no other way to think." "on the other hand, responsibility for every choice." that was an expectation," michael gay sr. says. jack nods, digging into a cupcake in honor of his 32nd birthday. growing up surrounded by their dad’s physics buddies had its drawbacks. rachel is a new york city–based fashion de­signer. so i made everything into a game." none of that was up for discussion. occasionally, they’d bring the fighting home. does she need help?’" recalls srinija, the youngest. mealtime debates could get so vicious, they horrified outsiders. the emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and hollywood. few recalled major rifts between their parents. "success and performance was not a choice. "parenting is not a democracy," nicole says. "that’s the one that really listens." "it was more like, ‘look around. everyone they knew was back in india. look how far it took them. she and her husband t.p. "i was a changed person." "just eating dinner was a test of current events." "i think he was high." some of the consistencies are fairly predictable. that creates a work ethic. "that breeds a certain kind of toughness." but esther has a theory. also, nobody got an allowance. i can and i will." "you cannot reach anybody’s goal. this clearly helped the dungey sisters. it’s part of our makeup." "he had his own moral compass. (her daughters dispute that particular anecdote.) that exposure also created motivation. "you talk to the subconscious. "it was a gut feeling. (she will appear on conviction this fall.) (he ended up losing half his finger.) here are six striking qualities they shared. "put things away. "it stuck with me. there’s an urgency." what’s mom doing? such experiences can fuel ambition. pay attention."

work program gives homeless dignity, hope albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful "there’s a better way" program, which hires panhandlers to work in maintenance jobs and also aims to connect them with services. kellie tillerson, director of employment services at st. martin’s hospitality center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. he was one that said, ‘i would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.’ " dozens of cities around the country have reached out to berry wanting to copy the program. (albuquerque mayor's office) republican mayor richard berry was driving around albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: "want a job. and it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life. his city’s poorest residents told him they didn’t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn’t know where else to go. next month will be the first anniversary of albuquerque’s there’s a better way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. and it inspired st. martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs. in partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. (city of albuquerque mayor’s office) berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. when they’ve been approached in albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, berry said. sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it’s remarkable," berry said in an interview. one man who recently got out of prison returned to st. martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs. she said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an id. tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them. albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful "there’s a better way" program. there is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout. that’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. a berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. "you can just see the spiral they’ve been on to end up on the corner. the program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point. in less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. the there’s a better way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. "he now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed," she said. a recent national law center on homelessness & poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas. "many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one. he was the first republican mayor elected in albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness. one man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years. "they’ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today." panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option. "it’s helping hundreds of people," berry said, "and our city is more beautiful than ever." when the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. it’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party. it’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. at the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed. "genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are," tillerson said. this republican mayor has an incredibly simple idea to help the homeless. and more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment. those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. the job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. panhandlers are hired to beautify the city. seeing that sign gave berry an idea. and it seems to be working. don’t assume they are lazy." "it’s life-changing for them. they don’t have a social security card. but that’s not necessarily the reality. they just needed a lift. anything helps."
now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. when a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore—it was something other kids at her school were doing too. it's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of glee star cory monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star finn hudson. not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. according to dan duncan, associate executive director at st. louis's national council on alcoholism and drug abuse (ncada), most heroin users start with pain pills as andrew did. and with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her. it's no wonder: in an interview with 60 minutes last year, national institute on drug abuse director dr. nora volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. "but when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that's when i knew i really had to do something." after a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. "i slept with him because i felt like he was giving something to me, so i had to give something to him," she admits. a star high school athlete who went on to play division i football for missouri state university, andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. like cory monteith, andrew was doing his best to clean up—and everyone in his life believed he could do it. "it wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin—we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically," he says. "the thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses," says st. louis county police chief tim fitch. but pain pills are expensive—legally and on the black market—pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin. cases like andrew's are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like emily seem to be more of the exception. "i was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that i needed to go to any length to get sober. "it became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. never even a recreational drug user, andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his catholic high school from smoking pot. in 2012 and 2013, local news reports in denver, chicago, atlanta, seattle, orange county, syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. "he would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could," remembers his friend, 26-year-old missouri native katie gerstenkorn. "i thought, maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is." what cory and andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. "looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why i was doing all these things." at first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. in 2008 duncan and his ncada staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. it's so hard to describe the pain and the misery i felt, the downward spiral," emily says. at fourteen, emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. by 2010, the year andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. despite her habit, emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. "my worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day getting high." before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. when andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. "historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. i had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying," emily says. he would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. "today i can be a part of things instead of apart from them. "he couldn't get away from the drug," says his mom, pam. she speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse. and it regularly is—on varsity sports teams, on ivy league campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods. emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. "it was like i was leading a double life," she says. is this deadly drug becoming a problem in american schools? during his sophomore year of college, andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. but his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban american youth. 23-year-old andrew jones asked his mom shortly before he died. add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. but now the average age is between eighteen and 25." doing heroin became part of her daily routine. "it's a hunger, it's a thirst. by fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. he was also a heroin addict. she returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. andrew went to his parents for help. for some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. by julia rubin "what have i become?" until the overdose that killed him. "he stole painkillers from me, actually." her supplier was 30 years old. soon after that, he broke his hand. "what's happened to me?" public, private, most of them." you throw all your morals out the window." he became addicted. *name has been changed. finally a switch flipped. eventually she caved.

remedy #5: bread and apple cider vinegar half a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot. remedy #4: onion and white vinegar like the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns. but it also means that you might become more aware of the less cute aspects of your feet... after years of wear and tear, being stuffed in shoes, and holding up your whole self, everyone’s feet develop rough patches and bumps. while calluses typically only look unpleasant and feel rough to the touch, corns — which are hard, rounded types of calluses — can be painful when pressure is applied, such as when walking or wearing a shoe. remedy #2: vitamin e or vitamin a while they’re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out. just like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight. there are simple, inexpensive, and all-natural ways to smooth your feet and get them soft and ready to show off, and you can do them all right at home. it’s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes. attach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn’t leak, and then cover with a sock. and of course, this isn’t just for feet, so if you have corns or calluses elsewhere, like on your hands, you can try these remedies there, too. leave the paste on for at least 10 minutes, then rub the corn or callus with a pumice stone, and it should come off. remedy #3: lemon peel slice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it. it can also make you self-conscious if you’re walking around barefoot or in shoes that leave your feet mostly exposed. remedy #1: apple cider vinegar and castor oil in a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet. dab a few drops of castor oil onto the corn, and then cover with some adhesive tape to keep everything in place. remedy #6: castor oil this remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business. like a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes. and since there’s a lot of evidence that shows going barefoot is really good for your overall health, you’ll definitely want to show off your tootsies this summer. rub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock. rub the paste generously onto a corn or callus, and wrap with a bandage to hold in place. read on to learn how to make your feet summer-ready, and then break out some nail polish and wiggle your toes! it will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse. rubbing the oil inside a vitamin e or vitamin a capsule is a great treatment for corns. a callus is a thick, tough area of skin that forms in response to repeated and regular friction or pressure. unlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface. it also means painting your nails cute colors, feeling the grass beneath your soles, and enjoying the cool breeze on your toes. but if you have corns, calluses, or other rough, hard skin on your feet? do this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days. remedy #7: aspirin crush about five uncoated aspirin tablets into powder, and mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to form a paste. the callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning. keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight. for corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak. so, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do? most people have calluses on their hands and feet caused by walking, holding a pen, or other activity. it’s also great for corns on small, hard-to-bandage places. if you’re wearing socks, wear old ones in case the oil leaks. this will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone. summertime means sandals — at least, when you absolutely have to wear shoes at all! press it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage. take a non-medicated corn pad and place around the corn. calluses might be unsightly, but they’re typically harmless and painless. she wraps a piece of bread around her foot. your body builds up a callus to protect your skin. a corn is actually a type of callus. repeat every night until the corn is gone. do this every night until the corn disappears. this is normal and natural, but it’s not always pleasant. but be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger! a word about filing down calluses: be gentle. when she takes it off? what is a callus? what are corns? never fear. shocking!
and a pentagon official in big trouble] "it used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but google maps and waze are letting everyone know," said bates mattison, a city councilman in the atlanta suburb of brookhaven, ga. "in some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood." (evelyn hockstein/for the washington post) when the traffic on timothy connor’s quiet maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, "continue on elm avenue . in portland, ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a "greenway" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. every rush hour, he went on the google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow. they have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including maryland and the district, officials have begun working directly with waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data. "the nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it’s not there," said julie mossler, waze’s head of communications. when population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby interstate 85. that made connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret. in california, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs. the cut-through disputes "are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic," said paul silberman, a traffic engineer with sabra, wang & associates in columbia, md. and their city councilman, tim male, tried to get google maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps’ feedback feature. one morning, neighbors awoke to a cacophony of honks and went out to find a backup dozens of cars deep, two drivers in the middle about to come to blows. but plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past connor’s takoma park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to waze and other navigation apps. and so connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of southern california and other traffic-weary regions: he became a waze impostor. tim connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in takoma park, md. although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, mossler said. in the los angeles region, waze’s biggest u.s. market, a city council person representing sherman oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms. traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow. waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. waze’s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, mossler said, not to create traffic jams. the traffic flow began to wane when the road construction ended, connor said, but remains three or four times higher than before it began. those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it’s happening at internet speed. waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to user's destinations. the apps didn’t create the traffic, mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn’t have known about otherwise. he put out two plastic watch-for-children figures, but one was hit by a car and the other was stolen. in takoma park, connor complained to the city’s public works and police departments, but nothing stemmed the flow. he experimented with waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports. "it didn’t do much and within two weeks they stopped showing up on the map all together," connor said. one afternoon, connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars. it was here that connor learned that some waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app. neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility. he continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks. average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app’s cartoonish interface. it’s not possible to fool the system for long, according to waze officials. "these great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire," silberman said. the company will suspend users they suspect of "tampering with the map," she said. "i could see them looking down at their phones," said connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. in response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections. when the first waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow. for one thing, the system knows if you’re not actually in motion. (jhaan elker/the washington post) [a warning left on a nanny’s car. for some drivers, their app-inspired shortcut became a permanent route. connor and his neighbors put up "no through traffic" signs. here's what you need to know about the app. the marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away. "that said, the traffic has to go somewhere," she said. "we had traffic jams, people were honking. "the apps reacted pretty quickly to that," said jonathan maus, publisher of bikeportland.org. traffic-weary homeowners and waze are at war, again. more important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers. but waze was way ahead of them. [a marine fights to prove he’s innocent of sexual misconduct. "they were on to me." now a new makeover is under way.] it was pretty harrowing." [three workers once died rebuilding this bridge. then a lost cellphone is found.] it worked. but still they came. soon after, connor went rogue. guess who’s winning? license plates stolen. ." .
but imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from around here we like good beer, we like good wine, we like good cocktails, and we certainly have had occasion to drink a few too many of those things. 7 of the 10 drunkest cities in america are all in a single state by noah kaufman | may 18 2016 around here we like good beer, we like good wine, we like good cocktails, and we certainly have had occasion to drink a few too many of those things. but imbibing to excess is a serious matter and the list released over the weekend from 24/7 wall street and compiled using data from the robert wood johnson foundation and university of wisconsin population health institute isn’t a top 10 anyone necessarily wants to be a part of. now the caveat to all this, is the numbers are all self reported, so the hopeful wisconsinite in me wants to believe that people from wisconsin are just a lot more honest about their drinking than people from california or utah. what that data showed was that 7 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 cities most inclined to binge are in the state of wisconsin. regardless, having nearly 27 percent of the adults in your town claim they drink to excess as they do in appleton, is not a stat that will likely go up on any welcome signs you’d see at the city limits. it looked at people who either binge drink (4-5 drinks in a sitting) or drink heavily (15 or more drinks per week) over 381 different metro areas. now, as someone who still answers "wisconsin" to the question "where are you from?" i am familiar with the stereotypes of camouflage-coated ice fisherman slamming millers on frigid january afternoons (or mornings), but this analysis went somewhat deeper than that. the full list of america's heaviest drinking cities is below.
costco &amp; sam's club recall ham for the most disgusting reason when you sit down for dinner and can't chew through a piece of your roast, then you know something's just not right. when one customer who took home a pre-cooked ham from a warehouse club store had this experience recently∏, both costco and sam's club issued an immediate recall. the affected product includes 6-pound vacuum-sealed packages of fletcher's fine foods classics black forest brand ham with natural juices, which were shipped to costco and sam's club stores and distribution centers in alaska, utah, and washington. if you have one of these hams, bring it back to the store for a refund or toss it in the garbage. so far, no one has been harmed by this issue and the u.s. department of agriculture announced no other reports of the unsavory extra ingredient. and if you have any questions, contact the company at 855-763-4621. shockingly, those un-chewable portions were covered in pieces of rubber material embedded in the meat. they were imported from canada and contain the label "est. #337" and packing code "16 oc 2016."

sacha baron cohen and his wife donate $1 million to syrian refugees sacha baron cohen (l) and his wife isla fisher (r) are donating $1 million (900,000 euros) to help syrian refugees, the charities receiving the money have said (afp photo/) london (afp) - british comedian sacha baron cohen and his wife are donating $1 million (900,000 euros) to help syrian refugees, the charities receiving the money announced sunday. they are also donating the same amount to the international rescue committee (irc) to help refugees in syria and neighbouring countries, particularly women and children, with health care, shelter and sanitation. the "borat" star and actress wife isla fisher are giving $500,000 to save the children to pay for measles vaccinations for children in northern syria. "by allowing us to make their generous donation to syrian children public, sacha and isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today," he added. more than four million refugees have fled conflict in syria for the relative safety of the neighbouring countries, according to the united nations. justin forsyth, chief executive of save the children, said the money would "save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children". millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country. david miliband, the ex-british foreign secretary who is president of the irc, called their gift a "great expression of humanity."
in-home sparkling water makers, such as sodastream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ada emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health. according to a spokesman from the american dental association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. "it’s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that’s in your classic soft drinks that the ph can drop below the critical ph of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. but a study published earlier this year in the journal of the american dental association found that the ph of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel. plain seltzer or sparkling water’s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. but you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water. bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. for example, coca-cola has a ph of about 2.4," making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because ph is on a logarithmic scale). an additional health note: club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. colas, with their low ph (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said dr. john ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at the university of alabama at birmingham, who co-authored the paper. studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters. the amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. but the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages. 2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. but check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives. too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most americans are already considered too high. does sparkling water have a downside?
it's been 10 years since paris hilton's sex tape with then-boyfriend rick salomon was released and the one-time reality star is still claiming she never cashed in on her x-rated night-vision romp. tmz caught up with the 32-year-old at lax following news that the hotel heiress is pursuing legal action against a slovenian porn site that's illegally profiting off her name and sex tape, "one night in paris." with her x-rated tape back in the news, tmz wanted to confirm hilton's claims that she never profited from it. the blonde heiress, who until then was best known for her antics on the party circuit, suddenly had her own reality show, perfume line, and like it or not, earned a place in pop culture history. while hilton may not have profited directly from the sales of "one night in paris," the tape boosted her profile enormously, turning her into a household name. it's a claim hilton has been making for years, telling british gq in 2006, "i never received a dime from it. "[i] never made a dollar," paris told the cameraman, adding that she never tried to get a cut of the profits either. it's just dirty money and he should give it all to some charity for the sexually abused or something. my fragrance makes enough, i don't need to worry about that." how much money did paris hilton make off her sex tape? to be honest, i don't even think about it anymore." "i make enough money in nice ways.
this is especially clear in the jason bourne trailer when a swat truck driven by vincent cassel (known only as the asset) rolls through vegas and cars going after damon's bourne. "i have always wanted to take a building that was going to be demolished and use that in the movie," marshall said. the results were all worth it for marshall, even if he had to send j.lo flowers for delaying one of her vegas concerts with all the road closures. with a little more reluctance, marshall did cop that this was close to a half-a-million in car costs alone — provided by manufacturers, but modified for the scene. the action-thriller starring matt damon as former cia assassin jason bourne brought an unprecedented closure to the famed las vegas strip for the spectacular car chase. "i counted, i had to pay the bills," said marshall, adding that these were just the destroyed cars from the scene. usa today one noble vehicle survivor was the asset's swat truck, which ended up rolling right through the riviera hotel & casino. it was like, 'i know it’s time to go to bed, i have to get up at 6 a.m. damon would watch the stunts from his hotel room late into the night, even facing an early morning call the next day for work. we had to ask producer frank marshall just how many cars were destroyed in the screen madness. it made for great watching even shooting the stunts which are almost entirely practical (vfx was used to erase safety elements and camera platforms). huge 'jason bourne' chase scene wrecked this many cars las vegas — what happens in vegas, stays in vegas. marshall pointed out that the building was set to be destroyed anyways (officially it was taken down in june). matt damon talks about destroying the las vegas strip in his new movie 'jason bourne.' so jason bourne and that truck just helped the cause. " and the second unit would go out and start blowing stuff up," said damon. producer frank marshall attends the las vegas premiere of 'jason bourne.' marshall knew the number right off the top of his head: 170 cars. unless it's full-on car-destruction-mayhem from the jason bourne shoot. and how did he know that number so quickly? surprisingly the custom-built swat truck was okay, allowing marshall to marvel. "but we have never shut down a main thorough-fare," said marshall. "it took out the marquee, went right into the lobby. that thing was built to last," he said. "i would stand at our window and watch. but i just want to see this.' "so we helped destroy the riviera." the bourne spy franchise has filmed chases in paris, moscow and tangier. "we would shoot all day. "i feel it’s our best chase yet. i am thrilled with how it came out." "they are all in a trash heap somewhere." but the swat truck survived pretty well. things went boom, cars got clobbered.
i was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when i decided i was going to focus just on my own business, then i made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where i am now at $100,000. by focusing on my business, i was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%. i would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, michelle's going to be president one day, or michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because i was always so competitive, determined, and independent. i decided i didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so i figured i would try to pay it off as quickly as i could so i didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. we like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long. there's always a joke in the rv community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it. before i was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. my husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time i quit mine in october 2013 when i was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. as soon as i earned any extra money, i put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and i wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it. if there's a way to save money, i'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, i'll go for it. i also made a little bit on google adsense and affiliate income, where i was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me. she got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months. at the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time. my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and i had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but i had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. how this 27-year-old made $1 million last year: in december 2012, when michelle schroeder-gardner graduated with an mba, she had $38,000 in student loan debt. we're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. we would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the rv thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since. she and her husband live in an rv, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in arizona when we spoke in late january) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including colorado national monument, mesa verde, rocky mountain, arches, moab, and others. our rv cost more than our house, but rving can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. at that time, it wasn't so much banks, but i do have bank advertisers now and i charge them much more than that of course. her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, making sense of cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports. yes, the salvation army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. it was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. though it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement. a lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them. six months later, i made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. now it's more a form of passive income, since i already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done. my husband has always wanted to live in an rv, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an rv. i created that because i had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. michelle schroeder-gardner of the making sense of cents blog and her husband, wesley gardner (courtesy of michelle schroeder-gardner) it also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. we haven't spent any money on tv since february 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching tv. i do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it. growing up, i was always super determined, so i don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. i was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but i realized i truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others. in those instances, maybe i partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. even though i make $100,000 a month, i'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says. i also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. but i stepped into an rv one day   we just decided to look at one   and i loved being in it. for the next few years, we plan on rving here and in canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. at that time, i charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar. i got the idea one day when i was reading cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site daily worth. the other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which i teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. my advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. it only took me a few months after i dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income. when my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but i would ignore all those emails. once i realized i could make money from my blog, i took them more seriously and gave them my rates. or i participate in a twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms. the main lifestyle change is that we live in an rv, are location-independent and work wherever we can. her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems. the month i paid off my student loans, july of 2013, i earned $11,000 that month. but we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible. if i had any more channels, i'd be in front of the tv all day long. it's comparable to living in a home, but i have a different view all the time. as a full-time blogger i have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. six months before i graduated, i received a letter stating how much i would owe every month when i graduated. i don't pay for any form of tv, i don't have cable, netflix, hulu or anything like that. in 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000. he taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. my side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things. there are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money. my mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so i learned what to do from him. there are 15-20 companies i actively promote on my social media and blog platform. so in addition to being a financial analyst, i also did a bunch of side jobs. now, i'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. i don't remember the number, but it was a number i felt was way too high for my income. i also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community. how does living in an rv make your finances different from other people's? how was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood? i'm not as stressed about money as i was just a few years ago. it was always expected of me   that i'd do something pretty out of the norm. by next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. i had actually started my blog in august 2011, before i graduated with my finance mba. we sold our house in missouri in july 2015 and now we work from wherever. i didn't start it thinking i'd make an income from it. here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly. i sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. i started reading that website and i became super-interested in personal finance blogs. and last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact. but i still love blogging, so i don't see that ending anytime soon. how much did you earn from the blog to begin with? did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff? i feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. we invest a lot in vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. i work longer hours when i'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. we had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. we also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills. if you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms. i stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. it's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out. in november 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. but many of our friends still call us down-to-earth. my third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. but once i realized i could make money, it boosted my motivation. in the beginning, in may of 2012, i earned $500. and by december 2012, i was up to $5,700 that month. i figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later. how did you pay off your student loans so quickly? it was going to be $500 a month or so. in 2015, i decided to stop doing all my freelancing. there are cheap rvs, and there are rvs worth millions of dollars. how much time do you spend on your blog? but the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive. i didn't even know blogs could make money. when did the blog start coming into the picture? since then, she has increased her income each year. how has your changing income changed your lifestyle? what do you do with your extra income? i just don't like to be wasteful. it's not below me to use a coupon. why did you start living in an rv? but i'm just as frugal as before. we usually stay in one place for a month. i currently do three blog posts a week. until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016? i'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. plus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. in 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000. i've always been super competitive, she says. i started my blog as a hobby. it really hasn't changed them too much. how has all this newfound wealth changed you? that's pretty much how it was. altogether, i was working 100 hours a week. how has your wealth changed your relationships? what were your expenses during this time? so we decided to give rving a shot. how exactly does the blog bring in money? in 2014, that increased to $164,000. between 40 and 60 hours a week. it doesn't really change. also, companies would approach me. how big is the rv? how big was your house? i'm still very frugal. do you have help? we kept clothing and photo albums.
decision of the ioc executive board concerning the participation of russian athletes in the olympic games rio 2016 decision of the ioc executive board concerning the participation of russian athletes in the olympic games rio 2016 https://t.co/wfe08hkeqf — ioc media (@iocmedia) — ioc media (@iocmedia) july 24, 2016 many athletes, officials and politicians are pissed about the ioc’s decision on russia, but to have an opinion on whether or not the fact russia will compete at these olympics is a travesty, you need to know what constitutes doping in the first place. you may have recently heard and read about russia’s state-run doping program, but do you really know you may have recently heard and read about russia’s state-run doping program, but do you really know what constitutes "doping" at an event like the olympics according to the according to the bbc , the world anti-doping agency is "disappointed" in the international olympic committee for not following its recommendation to ban russia entirely from competing in the rio olympics. a state-run doping program is obviously catastrophic for an even playing field in sports, but the international olympic committee’s refusal to really crack down on such a program undermines not only wada, but the entire a state-run doping program is obviously catastrophic for an even playing field in sports, but the international olympic committee’s refusal to really crack down on such a program undermines not only wada, but the entire olympics this also sets a dangerous precedent that encourages leniency when it comes to eradicating doping from international sports competitions. she was hoping to participate at the rio olympics as an "independent athlete," but we know now she was refused that request speaking on this upsetting

to get a blanket ban?... wada is the independent international organization tasked with monitoring doping in sports, but as you can see with a case like russia, its findings and recommendations aren’t always enforced by governing bodies like the ioc. #cantshakemyheadhardenough — katharine merry (@katharinemerry) — katharine merry (@katharinemerry) july 24, 2016 decision based on promises from

(sports) on whether to allow russian athletes to compete in rio 2016. sad day decision based on promises from russia, & leaving to the if's is a poor move from a position on strength. ioc are useless... like i said last week.. what exactly would a country have to do to get a blanket ban?... instead, the instead, the ioc concluded each sport’s federation will have the final say in banning individual athletes from russia and any other competing country. according to the according to the bbc , quite simply, doping is the act of an athlete taking a banned or illegal substance in order to improve performance . disappointingly, however, in response to the most important moment for clean athletes and the integrity of the olympic games, the ioc has refused to take decisive leadership. in addition, the ioc ruled any russian athlete who previously served a doping ban will not be allowed to compete in rio de janeiro, brazil in august. past olympians and those competing in rio haven’t turned a blind eye to the ioc’s findings, and they’ve been letting their frustrations out on twitter. this is what it actually means to be caught 'doping' at the olympics you and 3.1m others like this. unfortunately, i don’t think this is the last time people will use those words to describe the rio olympics. wada is very concerned by the message that this sends whistleblowers for the future. apparently, there are five classes of banned substances, but the most commonly used banned substances are anabolic steroids, which work to increase testosterone. ms. stepanova was instrumental in courageously exposing the single biggest doping scandal of all time. does not send out a strong message that doping will not be tolerated. such a disappointing decision by the ioc. you and 3.1m others like this. here’s where the real problem exists. bad day.
the ridiculously simple trick that'll keep your food from spoiling as part of huffpost’s "reclaim" project, huffpost taste will focus the entire month of july on simple ways you can reduce food waste in your own home. this ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. when the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it. there are many tools in our toolbox to make this all possible, and today we're going to talk about one more: the fifo method of sorting your groceries. this small step will ensure that you use up last week's groceries before digging in to the newer stuff. photo credit: almay here at the huffington post we spend a lot of time coming up with ways to waste less food, spend less money on groceries and eat better meals. putting away the groceries can sometimes feel like the worst part of this essential kitchen chore, so it's understandable if you just shove the groceries into the fridge without a second thought. instead, move all the perishable older goods to the front and place the newer groceries behind them. it's a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. here's what you need to do with that information: use this method at home. it's a simple concept, but an effective one. fifo stands for first in, first out. we get it, but stop. it really is that simple. start today and see the difference.

it’s safe to call narendra modi the most influential person in our country right now because he’s influential enough to get a couple to call it quits. the woman strongly believed that pm narendra modi is responsible for poverty and other terrible conditions in our country. so it was a regular, happy, couple-y day where the bride-to-be, a government employee was meeting some wedding-errands with her groom, a businessman. there’s one group that loves and adores him, and basically live, breathe, eat modiji, and there’s one group that hates him, cannot stand him, and will not appreciate any initiative that’s coming from his end. little did they know that the prime minister of india is going to be the reason why they’re going to separate. kanpur couple called off their wedding because of pm narendra modi. everything was fine until pm narendra modi was mentioned in their conversation. he strongly believed that namo is doing his best to fix everything, gradually. both of them had a heated argument on this topic and eventually decided to call it quits. that’s exactly what happened with a couple from kanpur. now imagine both these parties getting married to each other. there are two types of people in india. news sourced from toi news sourced from toi news sourced from toi you'll be surprised to know why. whereas the husband felt otherwise. how many politicians have done that before, eh? right. all hell breaks loose right? yep.
six of roald dahl's made-up words have been added to the oxford english dictionary to celebrate his centenary roald dahl is remembered for his solitary, kind-hearted child heroes—charlie, who visited a chocolate factory, and sophie, who befriended a floppy-eared giant, among them—and their triumphs over bullying adults. witching hour referred to in the bfg as "a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world to themselves." although the word was first found in the american thesaurus of slang in 1942, dahl’s giant’s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read the bfg: "every human bean is diddly and different. to honor the centenary of his birth this month, the oxford english dictionary has updated its latest edition today (sept. 12) with six new words connected to dahl’s writing, and revisions to six other phrases popularized by dahl’s evocative stories. human bean this is a mispronunciation of "human being," uttered by the giant in the bfg (1982): "we is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. the first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the british satirical magazine punch in 1842. but the beloved british children’s book author was also known for the distinctive language he used to create the vivid, often dark, worlds in which the characters lived. in may, the oxford university press also published a roald dahl dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author. oompa loompa the diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in charlie and the chocolate factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring gene wilder. new entries dahlesque the characteristics of dahl’s work—in the oed’s words, "eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour"—now have their own adjective. golden ticket these refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to willy wonka’s chocolate factory in charlie and the chocolate factory (1964). the first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter william hogarth, giving him admission to the vauxhall gardens in london, in recognition of his paintings of the venue. here are the new dahlisms added to the oed, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins. dahl also played with sound ("sizzle-pan" to refer to a frying pan in the bfg, for example). dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as "catasterous disastrophe" from the bfg). "he was using very linguistic principles," says vineeta gupta, head of children’s dictionaries at oxford university press. we can thank shakespeare for this evocative phrase: according to the oed, "witching time" first appeared in hamlet (1604). gupta called the phrase "typical dahlesque," reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning. the term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine books ireland. there was linguistic method to dahl’s mad use of language. the human bean is not a vegetable." some is scrumdiddlyumptious and some is uckyslush." scrumdiddlyumptious "extremely scrumptious excellent, splendid (esp. of food) delicious."
police records show that maria corral and suspect juan alberto contreras-rodriguez were arrested in a 2012 marijuana trafficking bust in which authorities seized 500 pounds of pot, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. startling link between kidnapped teen's mom and suspect authorities in georgia have revealed a new link between a kidnapped teen's mother and one suspect in her daughter's abduction. on wednesday, corral's daughter, 14-year-old ayvani hope perez, was found alive one day after being taken at gunpoint from her suburban atlanta home during a robbery. corral may have just been in the "wrong place at the wrong time," michael katz, the lawyer who represented her, told the journal-constitution. officials said that perez was in good health following a medical evaluation wednesday afternoon, according to nbc news. the charges against contreras-ramirez were dropped after aspects of the search were deemed unconstitutional. police have since arrested contreras-rodriguez, 40, and another man, wildrego jackson, 29. corral was never indicted on charges related to the drug incident. two additional suspects in the investigation remain at large, police say. more arrests are expected.
so when george papageorgiou, the owner of esti olive oil, asked me if i wanted to go to kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, i jumped at the chance. i can't help but think that everyone, even the french, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the greek rendition. before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and i would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to greece. the most unexpected country that rocks at making olive oil even though the peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country. before leaving the facility that day, george sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. with malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. i say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my greek heritage holds. concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words "traffic jam" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. as my hands turned a reddish-brown, i reminisced about the days i used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia. in greece it is said that the best of greek olive oils come from the peloponnese. as we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. the storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. we took the gathered olives back to the production plant where george had them ground into paste using large millstones. i know others might disagree with me, but i will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! like goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, george is in constant search for the olives that are "just right." i had always assumed that the grading of "extra virgin" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. i asked george if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. i was going to the peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some "liquid gold." if the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. the final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. the grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in greek mythology. with the booming introduction of greek yogurt into the u.s., i'm hoping that greek olive oil will soon follow suit. i looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit disneyland. it's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled. the differentiation of "extra virgin" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. in greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. in layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects. the olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. if the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. for years i have wished that greeks would be more like the italians. the italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. needless to say, i greatly enjoy the small villages of the peloponnese. the lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. in fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. the esti olive grove in kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. that night, and many nights since, i have enjoyed his olive oils. in each bite i can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. "this," he explained "is the traditional method used for making olive oil." after grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. i use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. to me this was kind of like winning the lottery. the best olive oils come from greece. george papageorgiou is trying to make that happen. being greek, i grew up eating olive oil. i began to collect olives in my little basket. i was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. i love using it to make popcorn. this is a process known as malaxation. i drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. i wanted to see what was behind every door. it's an important part of greek culture. this was something george clearly keeps in mind. it's a constant balancing act. workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. george shook his head. this was not correct. i snapped pictures.
pic.twitter.com/cvrghnhjjq - john authers (@johnauthers) june 24, 2016 uk managing director of travelzoo, a travel deals company, joel brandon-bravo, said during the referendum: "the next 24 months of negotiations will be crucial for british travel - particularly if the uk government wants to maintain inbound tourism from the eu, and avoid a price hike for britons wanting to travel abroad for holidays. 21 days ago 1 shares if you've booked a holiday, but are yet to exchange your pounds for a foreign currency, you're going to be a victim of britain leaving the eu i'm afraid. "britons are booking our £9.99 seats in record numbers in what will be the last big seat sale of its kind, as they look to flee a country which will be run by boris, gove and farage." "obviously top priority is dealing with the impact the referendum result will have on the value of the pound, but there are other factors that could make the result a big blow for the travel industry." this means that exchanging money from pounds to euros, for example, will make it more expensive to leave the country. the news of britain leaving the eu was so unexpected for airline ryanair that the company sent out an email offering deals 'celebrating remaining in europe'. a spokesperson for the airline said: "it's a good job we're better at running an airline than political campaigns. and your flights look like they're going to go up in price, too. credit: pa/lewis stickley is this the end of cheap flights? this is what happened to your currency while you were asleep. whereas the uk will be more affordable for people to enter. the english pound has now plunged to its lowest level since 1985, with sterling being down against every single major currency group. what does brexit mean for uk citizens who already booked summer holiday abroad? words by mark mcgowan featured image credit: pa featured image credit: pa featured image credit: pa good for tourism, bad for your pocket. good morning britain.
the isis says it's scared of only one country and it's not america or russia jurgen todenhofer is the only journalist who spent 10 days with isis and returned home still breathing. © newsweek (dot) com well, it's a very well established fact that the israeli army is not something to be messed with. well, it's a very well established fact that the israeli army is not something to be messed with. © wikimedia (dot) org hard to guess, but this is what the german journalist said in an interview and he added that israel is not included in isis' planned "first stage" of colonization in the middle east. while isis continues to make threat videos aimed at jews and upholds its aim to ‘eradicate jews from the face on the planet', they also shit their pants when they hear about the israeli army's supreme guerillas and metropolitan terrorism. but he also told the world that isis fears only one country's soldiers in the world. they not only have topnotch weaponry but also soldiers who posses the best man-to-man combat skills. along he brought the tales of isis-led tortures and atrocities. no, they are not american, russian or british soldiers. they are the israelis.
oscar favorite latest name rumored for "star wars" because an actor isn't truly an actor until they're rumored for a role in "star wars," chiwetel ejiofor is the latest name to surface as a potential participant in j.j. abrams' "star wars: episode vii." for now, abrams is busy writing the script for "episode vii" with lawrence kasdan (oscar winner michael arndt, who was hired to write "episode vii" in november of last year, left the project at the end of october). for his part, abrams refused to discuss whether ejiofor was involved in the "episode vii" casting merry-go-round, but he did tell blakely that the "12 years a slave" star was "a very talented gentleman." "everyone who wants to be part of that film, they know about," cumberbatch told the hollywood reporter when the subject of his "star wars" rumor was broached in a recent interview. ejiofor is just the latest actor to have his or her name attached to "episode vii" discussion, joining the ranks of benedict cumberbatch, saoirse ronan and alex pettyfer. they're trying to figure out what they want," michael b. jordan, who admitted to the associated press that he also auditioned for "star wars," said back in october. as relayed by times of london writer rhys blakely (via bleeding cool), ejiofor was recently spotted at abrams' office, which is now enough to start speculation about "star wars." the film is expected to arrive in theaters in 2015. even original players harrison ford, mark hamill and carrie fisher are still only rumored for the sequel, as their involvement has not been confirmed in an official capacity just yet. "i mean, everybody's going in on this project.

"emma roberts is still wearing her updo braids two days after debuting the glamorous look at the met gala." those braids have spent five hours on a cross-country flight, and they are still hanging on for dear life. the 22-year-old scream queens actress has worn the same french braids three days in a row. for that, decrees the daily mail, she must repent. roberts changed her clothes and her sunglasses, but not her braids. they remain. sneered the tabloid this afternoon. that’s correct.

sunday morning: out to brunch la dolce vita (13), at chaksibhari marg (00 977 1 4700612, no web), doesn’t have the best coffee in kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak’s cheese. take a hike nowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as durbar square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the unesco-listed historic heart of kathmandu. something of a thamel institution – everyone from jeremy irons to ricky martin have stayed here – the kathmandu guest house (19) is a bit rough round the edges these days, but still a good mid-range choice – it’s located in a former palace. take a view puff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the buddhist stupa of swayambhunath (1), known as ‘monkey temple’ on account of the hundreds of ‘holy’ monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. an aperitif owner prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to zibro (11) on chaksibari marg (00 977 984 1059449, no web), his laid-back rooftop bar where young nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying indians and european travellers. why 2017 is the year to visit kathmandu with the two year anniversary of the nepal earthquake approaching, the capital is back on its feet. rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the himalayan city’s sensory overload: temples and squares; prayer flags and sputtering scooters; merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung. lunch on the run climb six flights of stairs to the rooftop kasthamandap café (9) at 23 maru (00 977 1 6219177, no web) for an open-air coffee and snack under a sun umbrella. window shopping the thamel district, north of durbar square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to freak street). follow the flow down to jagannath mandir (4), a hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seems to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts. dine with the locals at bhojan griha (12), on dilli bazaar in the eastern district of kathmandu, traditional ‘newari’ dishes are served to guests in a 19th-century mansion, restored with painstaking attention to detail. the icing on the cake treat yourself to a massage by a seeing hands blind masseur whose fingers are attuned to muscle and tissue in ways that the sighted will never match. cultural afternoon the historic buddhist city of patan – effectively a suburb of kathmandu – is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured bagmati river. a walk in the park it says a lot that swapna bagaicha (14) on kaiser mahal, tridevi marg, is also known as the garden of dreams. nearly two years after the earthquake which devastated swathes of nepal and severely damaged the capital, kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. if it’s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out – the kumari devi, or living ‘child-goddess’ might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the kumari dar (5). however, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extend of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. it’s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine tibetan antiques. start at the northern, thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000rs (about £7.70) fee for free run of the whole area. you will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed. cordoned off for safety is the red brick old royal palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent basantapur tower (7) somehow remain precariously erect. every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping kathmandu back on to its feet. the façade of the kwa bahal (15), also known as the golden temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned ashoka stupas (16) are another. nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the rs 200 (£1.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use. to its north, frenetic thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. get your bearings the old city, known as durbar square, lies at the centre of kathmandu. take a ride for the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn ‘mountain flight’ along the crest of the himalayas. to the south, the bagmati river borders peaceful patan district with its own durbar square and expatriate communities. a botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it’s just a few minutes’ walk from central thamel. staying there hotel shangri-la (18) is, as the name suggests, as swanky as kathmandu gets. patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own durbar square. hotel horizon (20) is a gem tucked away in an alley near the north end of durbar square. sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent. the music is on multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing nepali folk-rock fusion in the background. beyond the former royal palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies. however, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances. if the day is clear, the whole of kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. exit via ‘freak street’ (official name jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over). it’s a great place to make new friends over a glass of local craft beer khumbu kolsch. it’s an inviting, low-rise modern hotel with traditional flourishes in a lush garden with cool pool. at the same time, support this commendable organisation which provides employment and independence for nepal’s blind men and women. a range of therapies are offered in a clinical setting, in its premises off jyatha road, thamel (17). getting there qatar airways flies to kathmandu via doha from heathrow, manchester, birmingham and edinburgh, from £685 return. the restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. and then there’s the fact it’s guarded by scores of ‘holy tortoises’. now's the time to go, says martin symington why go now? you’ll pass up close and personal many of the world’s highest peaks, including mount everest. there’s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. one good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is amrita craft (10) on chhetrapait. dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. breakfast on sequinned cushions in the courtyard is a treat. join throngs of pilgrims at shiva-dedicated mahendreshwar mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. there are commanding views over durbar square. local tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided – they're crowded, slow and not the safest. sit on the sunny terrace watching the street dramas of chaotic thamel below. other options include etihad via abu dhabi and jet airways via delhi or mumbai. open from 11am, meals around £8-10. an hour-long flight with buddha air costs us$192 (£158). doubles from £105, b&b. doubles from £65, b&b. doubles from £24, b&b. mains around £6-8. on a budget?
you've never heard the f-word this much in your entire life martin scorsese's "the wolf of wall street" features a lot of swear words. in honor of the film's proclivity for r-rated language, slackstory put together a compilation of every time the f-word was spoken, shouted, whispered or slurred in "the wolf of wall street." martin scorsese's "the wolf of wall street" features a lot of swear words. slate, in counting the f-words, found only 544, though the site acknowledged that some might have been missed. according to vulture, there are 569 variations on the f-word alone, including obscene gems like "f--kity," "f--kheads" and "f--kface." all of which is to say that this is a dirty movie! check out the site's nsfw effort below.
the same can be said for this alaskan malamute who watches proudly as her 14-day-old puppy howls for the first time. moms are so proud when their babies speak for the first time! this puppy just howled for the first time! watch what his proud mom does in response! she’s so impressed, she joins in!
as it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off we announced promoted user posts and we announced tests we’ll be running on sponsored headlines. these changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. you can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog. as we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. we have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to reddit. the mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure reddit is a welcoming place for all. i would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted. changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. the current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. there are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place. we’re still in the early days, but i’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it. the new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. this has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. we’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout. we’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process. in the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. the current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. both our iphone and android apps have had multiple releases, and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. we’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. we’ve seen great results from our anti-evil, trust & safety, and community teams. yesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators. on the product side, we’ve been busy. happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else. #2 will blow your mind.

legal weed sales halted in small town due to lack of staples as the list of of colorado counties and cities that are banning recreational marijuana sales continues to grow, another small town will also go without legal weed, but not because of a lack of interest; rather due to a lack of staples. the united states government took a historic step back from its long-running drug war last week, when attorney general eric holder informed the governors of washington and colorado that the department of justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults. unfortunately for klob and for the citizens supporting the measure, the petition effort failed because klob inadvertently violated colorado law when he didn't staple each petition volunteer's affidavit with the signatures they collected when he turned the documents in to the la junta city clerk's office. krdo first reported about local marijuana advocate tim klob's petition where he helped gather nearly 600 signatures to put a measure on the november ballot to allow recreational marijuana sales and industrial hemp grows in the southeastern colorado town of la junta. a64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but that home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold, however, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot. this week, grand junction became the latest major colorado city to ban retail sales of recreational marijuana by its city council members, even though several citizens requested that the issue be put to a public vote. colorado springs, the state's second largest city, voted to ban recreational pot shops last july and became the largest community in the state to opt-out of the state's new marijuana laws. john hickenlooper signed several historic measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, establishing colorado as the world's first legal, regulated and taxed marijuana market for adults back in may. a64 allows adults to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use even in those cities or counties that have banned retail sales. in the state's capital city of denver, which opted in on retail sales of marijuana, a two-year moratorium on new pot business licenses was recommended by the city council. colorado voters passed amendment 64 last november making the limited sale, possession and growing of marijuana for recreational purposes legal for adults 21 and over. recreational pot sales in colorado cities that opt-in can begin on jan. 1, 2014. colorado's 271 municipalities and 64 counties must decide by oct. 1 as to whether they will allow for legal recreational marijuana sales. though all necessary materials were included in the documents, the lack of staples voided the petition through a technicality. klob and la junta are now back to square one. "i see this as a game changer for our economy," klob said to krdo. "there’s no other industry knocking on our door right now." watch krdo's interview with klob here. colorado gov.

'star wars' actress daisy ridley fires back at body shamers daisy ridley: 5 things to know about 'star wars: the force awakens' star "endometriosis occurs when the normal uterine lining grows outside the uterus and causes pain," dr. mamta mamik, an obgyn from mount sinai hospital in new york, told abc news. the "star wars" actress shares an empowering message for women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome, and dr. jennifer ashton explains the condition.

'star wars: the force awakens' actress opens up about painful disorder parenting expert denise albert reports on some ideas to help care for children who are home sick from school. ridley has found that with the help of dermatologists and diet changes, like cutting out dairy and most sugar, she is finally making progress and finding relief. finally found out i have polycycstic ovaries and that's why it's bad," she wrote in the post. one symptom the "star wars" actress experienced was bad skin, which left her feeling self conscious especially being in the public eye. some of the 45th president's appointees and former campaign associates face questions about communications they may have had with russia during the 2016 campaign. the actress, 24, posted a selfie and explained that she has been suffering from endometriosis since she was 15. dr. mamik explained that "patients who have polycystic ovarian syndrome have high levels of male hormones that can cause acne." i've tried everything: products, antibiotics, more products, more antibiotics) and all that did was left my body in a bit of a mess. "star wars: the force awakens" star, daisy ridley, revealed a powerful message on her instagram thursday. the actor and former california governor's announcement came amid a feud between him and president trump, who remains an executive producer of the show. i hate wearing makeup but i currently don't want to leave the house without it on," she wrote in the instagram caption. ridley said she was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome after 8 years of tests. the department of homeland security is reportedly considering the proposal to deter mothers from migrating to the u.s. with their children. endometriosis occurs in women of child bearing age and can be hard to diagnose. sergei kislyak had communications during the campaign with some of then-candidate donald trump's key associates. the young tennessee woman jumped into action to perform cpr on the unresponsive child when the mother asked for help. the fbi meanwhile assured jewish community leaders that the rash of threats are a top priority for the bureau.

there’s only one way to stop it happening i hate to be an alarmist, but donald trump could be on course to be elected president of the united states – and the decisive moment may well come on monday night. so low are expectations for his performance on monday – where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him – that if trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to clinton’s face, his advocates will declare that he looked "presidential" and anoint him the winner. i know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose nader, who to this day blame gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). that’s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but donald trump could be on course to be elected president of the united states – and the decisive moment may well come on monday night. number cruncher nate silver, who gives trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had "never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about trump’s chances. same mistake as brexit nate silver the source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. the tv debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the american people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic. polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for america’s highest office – but who are refusing to back clinton. trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. in a two-party system like america’s, if you want to stop trump, then a vote for johnson or stein will not do it. if she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her crooked hillary, knowing that some 60% of americans believe she’s dishonest. the risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct. according to a new york times report well sourced from inside hillary’s debate preparation team, "she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes". had even a tiny fraction of those naderites decided to hold their nose and choose gore instead, there would have been no bush presidency – and no iraq war. never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the us into the catastrophic invasion of iraq. one survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for trump, but still found only 31% supporting clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian gary johnson and 15% the green candidate jill stein. that’s when he faces hillary clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. more than 90,000 voted for nader in florida, a state gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. it is indeed a referendum on trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote clinton. if he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle. how does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’ so where can hillary begin? as the new republic put it this week, "liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of george w bush." you’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of bernie sanders). never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about trump’s chances. she’s been advised that she mustn’t interrupt too much or talk over trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. in the last week, polls have put trump in front in ohio, nevada, north carolina and, most neuralgic of all, florida. she may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an american nightmare. in that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for ralph nader instead of gore. take two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. activists in berlin dismantle what they called a wall of hate showing donald trump in front of the brandenburg gate on 23 september. that this is an exceptional election because donald trump represents an exceptional menace, to america and to the world. (republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of jimmy carter to this day, just as british conservatives invoked the 1979 "winter of discontent" for over three decades. this week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself. how does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a trump presidency. only a vote for clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next us president. and for all her experience, clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. if that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen. but he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping george w bush. it is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure.) if that sounds like panic, then i’m not the only one. but 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it. if those numbers are replicated on election day, trump will win. so now, even though the hour is late, this is the case democrats must make. one reporter following trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task. older liberals haven’t seared the bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. in 2000 al gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. as joe biden puts it, "don’t compare her to the almighty. they never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. this was not something barack obama, or husband bill, ever had to worry about. on the night, bush came across better on tv. you might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. you don’t even have to like her. which brings us to a core problem facing hillary clinton. a new slate podcast is called time to panic . and here, younger voters are not to blame. but trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. and the alternative is president trump. he even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund. you don’t have to love her. he lies about 9/11. compare her to the alternative." this too stirs queasy memories of 2000. but the basic case is surely clear. same mistake as primaries, brexit." he lies about charity. but on he strides. president trump?
tmz recently spoke with jackie starr, who is mayweather’s stylist and has been cutting his hair since 2009. it sounds like a pretty good gig for her, as floyd tmz recently spoke with jackie starr, who is mayweather’s stylist and has been cutting his hair since 2009. it sounds like a pretty good gig for her, as floyd pays $1,000 per haircut and hits her up multiple times a week. just guess how much mayweather spends on haircuts © kevork djansezian/getty images the fact that mayweather spends that much on haircuts is hardly surprising given he spares no expense on essentially everything. nothing is more important to floyd mayweather jr. than his image, so we really shouldn’t be surprised to hear how much he spends on haircuts. "i cut his hair two times a week, three times is pushing it, but then it also depends on the occasion," starr said. that means there are weeks when starr makes $3,000 just for cutting mayweather’s hair. "if he’s in training i will cut him monday, wednesday and friday." she could do nothing else and pull in six figures annually by giving floyd haircuts. still, we can’t help but shake our head at it. not bad, right?
image: christie's auction house downplaying the iphone 7 so the next iphone can thrive maybe i'm reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year — a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign — in order to protect the next iphone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack's removal. and that's why, the more i think about it, the more i feel like the iphone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iphone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iphone doesn't carry that particular scarlet letter. i'm not completely sure how i feel about apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three — new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you've got the latest and greatest phone — but now that we're nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year. regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness apple introduces this year — and i'm sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate — the reality is that this will absolutely be the iphone remembered as "the one where apple dropped the headphone jack." this isn't to say i won't still buy the next iphone — i'm totally going to buy the new iphone in september — but if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iphone release we've seen. the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original imac. and, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iphone 7 bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of apple reporter mark gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iphone over the next few months. and thinking about it, i have to wonder: is apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year's iphone — you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp amoled screen — won't suffer? the big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iphone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. in case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iphone: it will be apple's fastest iphone ever. still, i'm sure i'm not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iphone and says, "huh. it's also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iphone. ok."     if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iphone release we've seen. and these would be amazing upgrades — old design or not — but the real headline is that this is the first iphone without a headphone jack.     the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the lightning port. not to downplay the new stuff (though i have thoughts on that, just wait), it's worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iphone predictions to a tee. the secret reason apple might be killing the iphone headphone jack apple is expected to unveil its next iphone in a few weeks. but we'll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. but i mostly just want to get this release over with so i can start looking forward to the iphone 8. a frequent point of discussion on our podcast, mashtalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, i'm still going to buy the iphone 7. i can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact. there will be at least one extra feature you can't get on any other iphone. i feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iphone will be minimal. adapters will be annoying and we'll all bitch and moan about how bluetooth just isn't good enough. and now, i guess we can add, "it won't have a headphone jack." waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. yes, yes, i've been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since january . fun fact: this was one of the first product designs from jony ive. that's the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iphone will be all positive. new design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. dunzo let's all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack. even tech editor pete pachal has come around to see the light. personally, i think that's ok. it will have apple's most advanced optics. and there will be backlash. oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? and apple loves to celebrate anniversaries. it will come in rose gold. we'll have moved on. the jack is dead. but that missing headphone jack? that's it. it's dead. so last year's problem.     a 20th anniversary edition macintosh from 1997. so, i suspect, does apple. people will grumble. pack it up.

although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease. here’s what happens when schools let transgender students use the bathroom they want at least once a day, pam retzlaff answered a call from parents concerned about her decision to allow a transgender student at edgar road elementary school to use a bathroom different from his biological gender. that was more than two years ago – a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male – yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students. atherton high school in louisville, kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and principal thomas aberli says there have been no problems. last month, the u.s. department of education and the u.s. justice department told schools across the country that title ix of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities. although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, biggs said a student visited him in november and explained that some transgender students didn’t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available. even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month’s deadly mass shooting at an lgbt nightclub in orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students. eliza byard, executive director of the gay, lesbian and straight education network, a new york-based organization that supports lgbt-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do. in camas, wash., across the columbia river from portland, ore., liberty middle school principal marilyn boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, "but it just didn’t happen." in a virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school’s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity. the majority of students surveyed said they didn’t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse. "there’d be times when i would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so i could come out of the stall," he said in an interview. in reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety. according to the gay, lesbian and straight education network’s 2013 school climate survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did. this month, the kansas board of education voted unanimously to oppose the obama administration’s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students. despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, aberli said that hasn’t happened at atherton. student alonzo hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the santee education complex, a high school in los angeles, where he is a junior. opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it’s an issue of safety for non-transgender students. it was new territory for retzlaff, then principal of the school in webster groves, missouri, a st. louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn’t open the bathroom. hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school’s existing bathrooms. "there were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he’s a pedophile," lara said. "those little things make a huge difference in a student’s day they’re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential," biggs said. according to fbi statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity – second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias. jose lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the los angeles school’s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest. "the students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change," lara said. "this was probably the best decision we made as a school all year," said kevin biggs, principal of roosevelt high school in des moines, iowa. "the most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we’ve been doing for the past two years," aberli said in an interview. in response, boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another. the 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. "i believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with," tokarz said. nevertheless, texas and 10 other states sued the obama administration last month, with mississippi, kentucky and kansas later joining the effort. in texas, lt. gov dan patrick has demanded the resignation of kent scribner, fort worth’s school superintendent, over the district’s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. and as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month. principal thaddeus tokarz said transgender students aren’t required to use it, though some choose to do so. in march, springfield central high school in massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. and students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change. the department reminded schools that those that did not comply with title ix requirements risked losing federal funds. some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment. "part of that could be how our community at liberty is really all about family," she said. "if they were listening to local authorities," she said, "they’d get out of the way." texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the obama administration’s policy. about half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted. four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. he’d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment. the school created two "all-gender," single-stall restrooms in february. students can still choose what works best for them. "it was hard in the beginning, very hard," she said. "it’s just kind of a non-issue." i had more parents in my office than ever before." "we just don’t accept that kind of intolerance." but ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan. "we wanted to make that possible." "we have several transgender students now," he said. patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it "social engineering." but the backlash is only beginning elsewhere. only two parents objected, boerke said. the concerns weren’t unfounded. "you can imagine my first open house.
adele’s album, 25, also made history when it sold 3.38 million u.s. copies in its first full week of its release, the biggest single-week sales tally for an album since nielsen began tracking sales in 1991. adele's "hello" video smashes youtube record adele continues to smash records as her hit song "hello" became the fastest video to break 1 billion views on youtube. the video for "hello" was previously anointed as the biggest debut in 2015 on youtube, with 50 million views in its first 48 hours alone. in just 87 days, the song easily surpassed the previous mark held by psy’s "gangnam style," which took 158 days to reach the billion-view milestone, youtube announced in a blog post on friday. adele also beat taylor swift’s "bad blood" for the most eyeballs on music platform vivo in its first 24 hours with 27.7 million. seventeen videos have made it past 1 billion views, according to youtube, and all of them are music-related. "if anyone deserves it, it’s adele and that song," susanne daniels, the head of original programming at youtube, told the new york times. adele’s "hello" joins "baby" by justin bieber, "lean on" by major lazer, "party rock" by lmfao, and "chandelier" by sia. it has sold 5.98 million copies so far.
bryant isn't the first to chime in for hillary to change her wardrobe; tim gunn once famously said of the politician, "i think she's confused about her gender" and bravo's andy cohen quipped that she should have a tv show called "project pantsuit." @hillaryclinton gets the advice she never asked for as "mad men"s costume designer and the producer of a design-inspired reality show, janie bryant could probably teach us a lot about fashion. in an interview with women's wear daily, bryant reveals her hopes for hillary: "hillary clinton could have an amazing fashion update," said bryant... clinton has found a silhouette that works for her, and she's sticking to it -- a tip we recommend to our closest friends. candidate clinton, she said, "could look totally dynamic, professional and serious all at the same time with beautiful blouses and skirts as opposed to the safe-pantsuit look." though we doubt the former senator with a proclivity for pantsuits asked for any advice. fair enough, janie -- but let's leave the pattern-clashing to michelle obama for now. now, for our two cents that nobody asked for: let hillary live! and for hillary, it's a pantsuit. but bryant already has a pupil in mind: hillary clinton. for some women, that's a fit-and-flare dress. "as a designer, i feel they could still be taken seriously without being so conservative." "women in politics play it very safe," bryant told wwd. for others, it's a little black number.

how one theory you never heard of explains everything donald trump does when donald trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, nate silver’s fivethirtyeight political blog said he had "a better chance of cameoing in another ‘home alone’ movie with macaulay culkin—or playing in the nba finals—than winning the republican nomination." when trump said orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters. trump’s public policy, explained with this in mind, now consider trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the pulse nightclub. other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window. while many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the second amendment, even the nra—which endorsed him—said, "no one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms." using the overton window theory to your advantage it is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. this theory, named for the late joseph p. overton of the mackinac center for public policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. this wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the overton window. even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the united states, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, medicaid, etc. the reality is that trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the overton window of political possibility. in other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the overton window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow. about a week after making the statement, trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons. with a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to fivethirtyeight and "exactly zero" chance of winning, according to the atlantic, how has trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 republican hopefuls? although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window. one thing is sure, though: while donald trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits. they only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current. the overton window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. the overton window: when you think about it, it’s so true... the lesson in all this is that politicians, as friedrich hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. to try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. these are within the overton window. for example, consider federal welfare policy.
section 922 as appearing in such appendix on september 13, 1994, as such weapons were manufactured on october 1, 1993; (ii) any weapon that is operated by manual bolt, pump, lever or slide action; (iii) any weapon that has been rendered permanently inoperable or otherwise rendered permanently unable to be designated a semiautomatic assault weapon; (iv) any weapon that was manufactured prior to the year 1899; (v) any weapon that is an antique or relic, theatrical prop or other weapon that is not capable of firing a projectile and which is not intended for use as a functional weapon and cannot be readily modified through a combination of available parts into an operable assault weapon; (vi) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition; or (vii) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine. section 921(a)(30) as appearing in such section on september 13, 1994, and shall include, but not be limited to, any of the weapons, or copies or duplicates of the weapons, of any caliber, known as: (i) avtomat kalashnikov (ak) (all models); (ii) action arms israeli military industries uzi and galil; (iii) beretta ar70 (sc-70); (iv) colt ar-15; (v) fabrique national fn/fal, fn/lar and fnc; (vi) swd m-10, m-11, m-11/9 and m-12; (vi) steyr aug; (vii) intratec tec-9, tec-dc9 and tec-22; and (viii) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as, or similar to, the street sweeper and striker 12; provided, however, that the term assault weapon shall not include: (i) any of the weapons, or replicas or duplicates of such weapons, specified in appendix a to 18 u.s.c. if a gun’s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it’s a "copy" or "duplicate," and it is illegal. with this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. on wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in massachusetts. "assault weapon", shall have the same meaning as a semiautomatic assault weapon as defined in the federal public safety and recreational firearms use protection act, 18 u.s.c. we recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before wednesday. it prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the colt ar-15 and ak-47 and explicitly bans "copies or duplicates" of those weapons. i could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but i wouldn’t want to let the wind out of the ag’s sail. every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an "assault" is now strictly illegal. assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in massachusetts. in the face of utter inaction by congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so. you can’t have a "mass shooting" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding americans. in the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. they sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests–they’re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. but gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a "copy" or "duplicate" weapon is. breaking: this state just banned the sale of all semi-auto rifles, effective immediately well, we all knew it was coming. i thought she’d just said it was legal to own them if you’d bought them before wednesday. the directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a "copy" or "duplicate" of a prohibited weapon. what about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners? if washington won’t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. now she’s got a moral obligation to get them "off our streets." if i were in massachusetts, i’d be feeling a bit paranoid right now. the massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban congress allowed to expire in 2004. they market "state compliant" copycat versions of their assault weapons to massachusetts buyers. but our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. wait–to get the guns off the street? what does the state consider an "assault weapon"? and this time it is massachusetts attorney general maura healey. time for some crafty legal eagles to start dismantling this gibberish. she published this in the boston globe today. this directive does both. that will end now. right. yes, you’ve read correctly.

shevchenko was at a restaurant, campero’s chicken grill, with her coach pavel fedotov, when a group of men stormed the place. reports have confirmed that shevchenko’s coach, pavel fedotov, was armed with a gun and decided to take matters into his own hands. the area is relatively known for high crime, in fact this was the fifth time that campero’s chicken grill has been robbed. the men demanded that any money on the premises be handed over, as well as personal belongings that the customers had on their person. former champion, holm, lost her ufc bantamweight title to miesha tate earlier this year at ufc 196. shevchenko is scheduled to fight former ufc bantamweight champion holly holm on july 23 at ufc on fox 20. holm won the ufc title in november at ufc 193, where she stunned the world by beating the formerly undefeated, ronda rousey. her last fight was at ufc 196 where she lost to the now number one contender, amanda nunes. she has won gold at the ifma world championships nine times in the last 13 years. it is believed that the men were extremely violent, beating people who refused to hand their personal belongings over. fedotov is a muay thai veteran, who won gold last weekend at the world muay thai championships in sweden. video footage of the incident shows shevchenko running to fedotov’s side to check he is okay. firing at the group of men, fedotov allegedly killed one of the men. ufc fighter valentina shevchenko involved in armed robbery shootout ufc fighter valentina shevchenko was today involved in an armed robbery shootout in chorrillos, peru yesterday. given both women have extensive backgrounds in boxing and kickboxing, expect this fight to be full of striking and excitement. should shevchenko pull of a huge win against holly holm, she would leap into ufc title contendership almost instantly. he was then shot himself in the stomach, where he was rushed to hospital for treatment. despite being relatively unknown in the mma scene, schevchenko’s resume is jam packed with success. she holds an impressive 58-2 kickboxing record and a 12-2 mixed martial arts record. footage of the incident can be seen here. he is also married to shevchenko’s sister, antonina. it’s currently unclear what his condition is.
the world’s safest country, in terms of homicide, is tiny liechtenstein, which didn’t have any murders in 2012, but there are a number of countries, especially in europe and east asia, with rates lower than 1 per 100,000. the americas overtook africa as the region with the world’s most murders in this year’s report, accounting for 40 percent of the world’s homicides, though that's a somewhat misleading figure as there are wide geographical variations among and within countries in the region. according to the report, a group of countries—all of them in either the americas or africa—accounting for just 11 percent of the global population are the location of 46 percent of the world’s homicides. men accounted for 95 percent of the perpetrators and 79 percent of the victims of homicide in 2012, a rate that is "consistent across countries and regions, irrespective of the homicide typology or weapon used." overall, the number of murders in the world is relatively stable—even declining slightly—but the most striking finding in the report is how geographically concentrated homicide is become. overall, one in seven homicide victims in 2012 were men between the ages of 15 and 29 living in the americas. and the world's safest country in terms of homicides is... honduras has the world’s highest homicide rate at 90.4 murders per 100,000 people, and it’s not even close. the americas were also the only region where shooting accounted for the majority of homicides. the u.n. office of drugs and crime released its 2013 global study on homicide this week. the rates were driven largely by gang and drug violence. belize, el salvador, guatemala, and jamaica all have rates around 40. homicides are concentrated by gender as well. venezuela is next with 53.7. joshua keating joshua keating is a staff writer at slate focusing on international affairs.
here's how long you can hold onto your cosmetics (via @gma) "good morning america" teamed up with lifestyle expert april franzino, the beauty director at good housekeeping magazine, to find out how long you can keep day-to-day products such as makeup and shampoo. "it's hard to keep track of every single thing that you have so before you go to use any product just take a second and think, 'okay, have i had this for a really long time?'" franzino's tips to save money on beauty products include swapping out liquid eyeliner in favor of a longer-lasting pencil and buying products that have pumps instead of traditional lids because they prevent bacteria from getting in. franzino also recommended not to buy items with an expiration date in bulk because you may end up having to throw it away before you use it. "that's where bacteria can grow," she told abc news, "so you really need to be careful about switching that out every three months at least." products with active ingredients, however, such as toothpaste, are regulated by the fda, meaning they will have an exact expiration date that experts advise you should probably stick to. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) does not regulate cosmetics, but does warn consumers that "a cosmetic product may go bad if it is stored improperly — for example, in a place that is too warm or too moist." liquid makeup that is used around the eyes, such as eyeliner and mascara, should be replaced every three months, franzino added. view photo as far as hair products go, franzino advised that shampoo and conditioner are generally good for a year. "at that point you may start to notice that they're not performing as well," franzino told abc news. liquid makeup, such as concealer and foundation, should be replaced every six months, franzino said. "you should not be using it beyond that expiration date, especially sunscreens," franzino said. powdered makeup can last about two years before the colors begin to look a bit off, according to franzino. "so you might want to switch them out." aerosol spray products can last much longer.
the things you should never, ever do at a wedding these are the things to avoid on your big day tacky is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. "at one wedding i attended, there was a cash box by the door that said "please contribute to help cover the cost of the wedding," someone else added. other agreed sharing their own awkward experiences, "my cousin and her husband did a thing where they had her husband's two kids go around with baskets and see which kid could get the most money." "when my childhood best friend got married, we were sent an announcement with instructions to send money to a travel agency for the bride & groom's honeymoon," one user explained. a huge number of users declared marriage proposals one of the tackiest things you can do at someone else’s wedding. what’s distasteful to some may be perfectly normal to others, and vice versa, but there are some things we can all agree on. and, while the majority agreed that a donation instead of gifts to couples that already had homes was fine, there were some circumstances that really had them vexed. have you seen that video doing the rounds on facebook where a guy proposes to a bridesmaid at her best friends wedding? the general consensus is that these acts are unquestionably tacky and definitely not the way to go on your big day. "then it was included on the invitation that space was very limited and they wouldn't be inviting me to the wedding. from cringe-worthy dance routines, cheesy tunes and being stuck at the singles table, chances are you’ve experienced at least one of these at a wedding. "miserable marriage jokes are never really funny, but especially so at a wedding," said one person.

some researchers claimed it was unlikely ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle. "this really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction — you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women." other factors included how good ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles. to solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring — the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women. although the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that ismaïl could have actually had all these children, "the results from them were all quite different from each other," oberzaucher said. how one man could have fathered 1000 kids sultan moulay ismaïl of morocco, "the bloodthirsty," reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000. based on reports by dominique busnot, a french diplomat who frequently traveled to morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. the simulations suggest ismaïl needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. ismaïl's rule was the longest in moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years. "we were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and moulay could still achieve this outcome," study lead author elisabeth oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the university of vienna, told live science. for instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. ismaïl, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the moroccan alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. according to the guinness book of world records, ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death. however, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting ismaïl had said. at that time, ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years. the women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. the simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. they found the sultan could have set this record. he was sharifian — that is, he claimed descent from muhammad, the founder of islam. oberzaucher and her colleague karl grammer detailed their findings feb. 14 in the journal plos one. any suspicion of adultery against ismaïl was severely punished.
customer reports cook with down syndrome but was shocked when they discovered who he was a customer dining at ankar’s hoagles in chattanooga, tennessee (us) noticed that the cook was suffering from down syndrome and so s/he decided to report the said worker to the health department. when i learned that someone had the audacity to file a report with the local health inspector over an adult with down syndrome being in the kitchen of a restaurant that he is not just employed at, but that he owns, i was floored. but when the health department came to the restaurant, they were shocked to discover that the ‘worker’ with down syndrome was actually the restaurant’s manager and co-owner! if the people out there who constantly ridicule people with disabilities had even half of andrew’s capability to love everyone, this world would be a better place. from greeting customers to cleaning the dining room to working the grill, andrew works tirelessly to make sure our business is a success – and he does it all with a smile on his face. it makes my blood boil that there are people in this world who don’t have an ounce of kindness in their heart to appreciate what an amazing person he is. he captioned the picture with this: ever since my dad passed away, my little bro has been working day in and day out at ankar’s hoagie’s to ensure that my father’s legacy keeps going strong. the fact that there are people out there in this world that view people with disabilities as sub-human disgusts me. trust me, the world would be a much better place if everyone had andrew’s ability. sometimes i sit back and marvel at andrew’s ability to love everyone... even people who aren’t deserving of his kindness. instead of talking with the restaurant’s owner and manager (trust me, she should’ve done that), she’d rather file an official complaint against the worker. but as seen in the picture, despite being the manager and co-owner, andrew works tirelessly. i challenge every single person who reads this to take a minute to put all differences aside. apparently, shortly after his father died, andrew took over and started becoming a manager that every worker loved. whether it’s ability, race, sexual orientation, religion, whatever – try to put your differences aside and love one another. he cooks, and serves, and practically does every worker in his restaurant does. his brother alex shared a picture of his hardworking brother on instagram, which instantly gained much love from many netizens. he’s not the disabled one, we are. love you, kid. he knows no hate.
to help you gear up for the cooler temps, we recommend that you get your winter wardrobe in order, and the best way to start is by stocking up on cozy knits. we can't believe these are all under $100 getting out of bed in the winter is hard enough. we've rounded up 19 warm sweaters that are all under $100. luckily, believe it or not, there are tons of toasty sweaters that are already on sale. it's even tougher when you don't have the best warm clothes to brave the cold. wearing fur and cashmere to stay warm would be ideal, but those bad boys hardly come cheap. you're welcome.
"there’s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don’t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you’re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry," explains dr. jenkins, who has also been a part of the minority business council for three years. greene adds that she didn’t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it, but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy: "there was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and i knew that was me. "so in 2010, when i saw the state of colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, i decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises." 15 of the most powerful women in the weed industry despite donald trump's devastating election day win that put most of the country into a tailspin, cannabis supporters had one to celebrate this year, as eight states legalized weed for medicinal or recreational use. "i use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge, experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry, and make it mean something for them and their communities," says greene. women—from researchers studying the benefits of cannabis over opiates, to award-winning chefs cooking up the most delicious edibles on the planet, to those who are facing massive jail time for activism and legalization efforts—are the true heroes of the cannabis industry, and it’s time to recognize that. gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving "we’re doing something that has never been done before, so there’s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended," she explains. "that’s true with most laws often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that’s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn’t get implemented, then it’s as if it didn’t pass." available in a variety of combinations to heal what ails you—from anxiety to ptsd to period cramps and pain—moxie meds grows their cbd-rich flowers following organic standards to create what is known as feco (full extract cannabis oil), using organic ethanol to extract the cannabinoids and terpenes. "i was informed that the state of california knows what’s better for my daughter than i do and that if i did anything different than conventional treatment, then i’d be acting outside of medical advice and that i would be a threat to her. "one thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it’s been men’s faces at the forefront and yet it’s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work," explains lyman. not to mention, working to help victims of america’s war on drugs: "we’ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn’t stand for that anymore." "you’re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they’re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary," lyman explains. along with working to fund cannabis research, lyman’s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society. rachel k. gillette, attorney an unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones, if you work with weed, you'll likely need a lawyer at some point. she says the favorite part of her work is without a doubt assisting patients, from veterans whose ptsd is diminished with treatment, to elderly patients who now live happier and healthier without chronic pain, to women who are no longer feeling stuck without options to address their reproductive concerns. along with her work as a healer, dr. jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege. "my oldest daughter kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and i questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her," explains dr. jenkins. lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn't mean they're the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. charlo greene, founder of alaska cannabis club you may remember charlo greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of alaska cannabis club. but if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you’ll be taken seriously." but as trump's win proved true in politics, the cannabis industry, too, is riddled with white men in power—even if they aren't the ones who deserve all the credit. lynne lyman, california state director for the drug policy alliance while california cannabis users celebrate their state’s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment, (nice hollyweed sign), lynne lyman’s work is just getting started. beyond helping write the legalization laws that just passed in the state of california, dr. jenkins can take 500 varieties of herbs and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ails you. surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what’s going to help you persevere. her next court appearance is january 11, and she’s assembled a top-notch legal team and is feeling hopeful, yet knows both america and the weed industry still have insurmountable work to do. dr. lakisha jenkins, master herbalist dr. lakisha jenkins has a doctorate in naturopathy, is a member of the american herbalist guild, and is a master herbalist, and founding board member of the california cannabis industry association. unfortunately, i was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, i started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives." "i’m facing 54 years for creating the alaska cannabis club, so in the meantime, it’s dreary that my life could be over this year," she explains. now living in los angeles, greene says, "i’m charlo "fuck it, i quit" greene, and i’m credited with the legalization of marijuana in alaska." "i think a lot of the work that i’m doing is overlooked because i am a woman and because i am a person of color." "but if i stop doing what i know i am here to do, which is share these amazing stories and activate people, then the state has already won." her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of colorado. unfortunately, despite the abundance of healing dr. jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. that’s where rachel gillette comes in an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don’t let anything get in your way. she's the california state director of the non-profit organization drug policy alliance, "the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights." "women have always been healers throughout history and this (female) plant represents what i personally consider the fastest moving area of science and medicine," says peters. i want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they’ve had their families destroyed. we also add organic strawberry extract for flavor balancing - doesn't taste overwhelmingly like strawberry, it just balances out the plant and bcp flavor profile," explains peters. "it will be interesting when they try to drag up club members that literally credit the [alaska cannabis club] for saving their lives. "the advice i give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. i think the state of alaska will be on trial just as much as they’re putting me on trial." "my family is from the mississippi band of choctaw indians, so we have native american lineage and my grandfather is a native healer," she explains. to celebrate women in weed, we spoke to 15 of the most powerful and influential women in the business: 1. "we need women to help bring cannabis medicine to the next level for the sake of patients everywhere."' greene’s success has come with a heavy price that proves the war on drugs in far from over. jessica peters, president of moxie meds moxie meds, a cbd-rich line of cannabis tinctures, is medicine for women, by women. making sure you’re a good neighbor, and you’re working with the community that you are based in." there’s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it’s just any other industry. at the time, gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. dr. jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques. so i’m gonna continue what i’m doing, just on my own terms with the weed show." however, gillette’s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry. an exceptional entrepreneur, she’s also behind newcannabistimes.com and the founder of go greene, a cannabis diversity summit series. "i’m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. if you love pot and natural medicine, she’s someone you want to know. "i’ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana," says gillette. you have to find a way to expand and let other people in. "i just went back to my native roots and just researched." "we add organic basil extract (which contains beta-caryophyllene) and lab grade, u.s. made, naturally extracted beta-caryophyllene (bcp) as well. because people are going to challenge you all the time. "we always say november 8th wasn’t the end, it was the beginning," she explains. her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? kiona passed away in january 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. that’s a policy priority for dpa."

while 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started. typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions. one would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the earth's crust, the moon and even meteorites. eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: the levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. the natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. and as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident. but in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the earth's crust, found in okla, gabon. uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions. then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. this conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. the pile of rock in the ground in okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago! the uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. it was discovered in 1972, when some french scientists took uranium ore from the mine in gabon to test its uranium content. the reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed – including the enigma of the "missing uranium." nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. what might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium. the water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. the nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. the neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. as the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. this neutron fuses with a uranium 235, and together they combine to form uranium 236, which is unstable. these neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction. this neutron can then whoosh towards another uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. an ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. however, these french scientists found something fishy: the uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. the first was owning a good percentage of uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. that meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. after a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. featured image: danilo russo/flickr source: naturally occurring nuclear fission source: naturally occurring nuclear fission source: naturally occurring nuclear fission uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. the conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows. is there really a 2 billion-year-old nuclear reactor in africa? unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened. the second condition is a source of neutrons. maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. this watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years. it hadn't been lost or stolen.
inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with roman's bot, she's now working on replika, a new product that, like eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. the goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own "roman" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of "friend" that is there every day to talk to, to make you "more connected with your friends and yourself." they let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data — the texts and tweets and "likes" and photos — and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were. the natural progression of eterni.me or replika's ideas would be to combine the ai with realistic digital 3d avatars (something eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). long-time vr researcher jacki morie coined the phrase "the ultimate selfie" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too. kudya and other mourners could "speak" with roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions — its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence. while the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy — edging into bizarre "uncanny valley" territory — experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved. but while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die. facebook allows people to "memorialize" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead. but intention or not, a person's replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that eterni.me's avatars could. she imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in vr is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone. the silicon valley-startup eterni.me aims to let people preserve their "most important thoughts, stories, and memories" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor mark taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones. "i often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'did you ever forgive me for what i did in ....?'" ultimately that process will build the ai's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today. currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called xxarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy. "we want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced." how technology will bring loved ones back to life the theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years. "we chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary," explains eterni.me founder marius ursache. though eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet. "you'll be scanned and have this 3d construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an ai," she says. your friends could talk to your replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you. both servaty-seib and grief therapist dr. bob neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. "now even the first replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it." or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says neymeyer. the app will connect to a person's facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. if people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? over 100,000 people have reserved their replika "name" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. how could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? aftertalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. but now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. he's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave. such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents. they are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death. while the roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. deadsocial allows users to set up a curated facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. earlier this year, entrepreneur eugenia kudya created an ai-powered chatbot in honor of her friend roman mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. heather servaty-seib, a grief researcher and purdue professor says that it's in line with the "continuing bonds" theory of bereavement. it could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, servaty-seib says. "the artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years," ursache says. the bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. "a lot of the people who expressed interest in eterni.me don't have this time. kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public. this forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives — preservation first, technology second." until we can really can upload our brains to the cloud, that's our best shot at immortality. the concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist. talking to the bot helped kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend. "it's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable," kudya says. "this kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories." death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one. they can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave. "now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased," he says. their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. (or through a phone booth, like in otsuchi, japan where tsunami survivors "call" their lost loved ones.) by transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. digital legacy tools like eterni.me or deathlogic don't just serve the people left behind. meanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to "life." these services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves. still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. he says.
breast cancer rates are on the rise among these women breast cancer rates on the rise among black women though the reason is unknown, researchers say breast cancer rates increased 0.2 percent among black women but remained stable among whites between 2006 and 2010, the latest time period assessed. though the reason is unknown, researchers say breast cancer rates increased 0.2 percent among black women but remained stable among whites between 2006 and 2010, the latest time period assessed. breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except american indians/alaska natives, while african-american women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. in june, a jama study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found. authors of of the acs report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to er-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for er-negative breast cancer, which is more common among african americans. historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. however, incidence rates are now converging among white and african-american women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. "although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. however, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival," dr. stephanie bernik, chief of surgical oncology at lenox hill hospital in new york city, told healthday .
even so, he said he doesn't feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that pokémon go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday. he said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the pokémon go radar was down so he had to order an uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it. after getting off at work around 6:00 pm at applico, a platform innovation company , johnson would meet up with his girlfriend, have dinner and then together head down to pokémon hotspots such as grand army plaza in. many times they would get to know fellow pokémon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when pokémon tend to spawn. we found out what happens after you catch every pokémon nick johnson has caught every pokémon in pokémon go that is available in the u.s. johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 pokémon mark, that kept him out till 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. "i’ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in north america) as far as i know," johnson said. as for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain pokémon. if she decided to leave before him, he said she would give him her phone to help her collect more monsters and he usually found himself heading home around 12 a.m. or 1 p.m., the normal time he goes to sleep. but staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for pokémon, citing a story of trying to catch a porygon. the brooklyn-based tech worker announced this week he had nabbed the 142 local monsters on reddit with a screenshot of his pokedex, and later confirmed this feat to business insider he owes his new fame to plain old shoe leather. secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good. let friends in your social network know what you are reading about pokemon trainers flocked from around the bay area to attend san francisco's pokemon go crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked pokemon over discounted themed drinks. he said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. in the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open — a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions. marriott rewards has offered to sponsor johnson to go to europe, japan and australia to catch the regionally based pokémon and finish his collection, he told usa today friday. nick johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every pokémon in the popular mobile game pokémon go. for now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into applico. "i probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if i hadn't got those great tips like the dratinis in jersey city," johnson said. however, it is rumored these pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in north america that users can pick up at pokestops. ​using gps and augmented reality, the game developed by niantic labs invites players to catch the colorful pokémon monsters best known from nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. off on an international trip to catch the pokémon elsewhere in the world — underwritten by an international travel company. that is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of north america. johnson's iphone health app stated he has walked an average of 8 miles per day since the game was released on july 6th. launched in early july , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare pokémon. at least for now until he takes his international pokémon catching trip. "i was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. "that is above and beyond anything else i did to catch one," johnson said. mime , farfetch'd and kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in europe, asia and australiasia, respectively. "i was close to the end so it was extra motivation." he's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model. i’m a lot healthier — i think i lost about 8-10 pounds." beside growing up playing the pokémon games, of course. an international trip, he tells usa today. "my childhood dreams of being a pokémon master have come true." this trainer's solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning. "i feel great," johnson said. a marriott spokesman confirmed the trip. "i learned that the hard way," johnson said. so now what? mr. central park .

while it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the united states needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. according to reports from pbs and the washington post, all marijuana used in research must be supplied by the federal government, and the pot that the government has been handing out looks like trash. sue sisley, a researcher with maps studying the medical effects of marijuana on u.s. veterans suffering from ptsd told pbs the weed supplied to them for the study doesn't even smell like weed. though there way may be hope on the horizon: the dea announced in the summer that it would start to allow other bulk growers the ability to provide cannabis for medical research, though none have yet been approved. rick doblin, maps’ director, blasted nida's capabilities by telling pbs, "they’re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we’re hoping to be approved by the fda as prescription medicine. " the farm is run by the national institute on drug abuse (nida), and is the only facility licensed by the dea to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the dea. when confronted about the mold and potency, nida and the university of mississippi told pbs that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped. https://t.co/uknsywqpwq pic.twitter.com/ibqv8p5nwu — washington post (@washingtonpost) march 13, 2017 though it's relatively simple to grow, the quality of cannabis you can purchase (legally or illegally) in the united states can vary greatly. as the post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. in the age of stickiest-of-ickiest-and-rising thc percentages, it appears the united states government still supplies researchers with low grade brick weed you probably smoked in high school. nida blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn't handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. there they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. maps fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts "were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing," according to pbs. regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't. sisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in colorado as a part of typical protocol. and while weed comes in plenty of colors, shapes, densities and sizes, the pot analyzed by pbs and the post looks extremely yellow and filled with stems. lighting, air quality, humidity and pests can all play a massive role in the end product, so growing weed may be pretty easy, but growing great weed can be pretty taxing. but the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in denver. all of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the university of mississippi. in colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent. so the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot. not only is the weed bad, but sisley claims it was moldy as well. actually, it's worse than the weed you smoked in high school. one sample was supposed to contain 13 percent thc — it reportedly had just 8 percent. this is what happens when the government tries to grow weed. (it's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.) shockingly, 13 percent thc is the highest percentage nida offers. it doesn’t smell like cannabis.' government marijuana looks nothing like the real stuff. it doesn’t smell like cannabis," she said. 'it doesn’t resemble cannabis. "it doesn’t resemble cannabis. or getting from an illegal delivery service in new york city. (hint: it ain’t good.) see for yourself.
the sacramento bee told the story last year: lester holt sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of california state university, sacramento, to work at a san francisco radio station. before the lights go on, here are five things to know about holt: holt is a registered republican donald trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. he was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked clinton about the "reset button" with russia during her tenure as secretary of state. holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992 holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the united stats from jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since carole simpson in 1992. gwen ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and bernard shaw moderated the vp debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president. these are the people who will be lobbing questions at republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. (photo by jose luis villegas/the sacramento bee via ap) lester holt, anchor of "nbc nightly news" will moderate monday's presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump. dominic carter, a fellow black tv journalist who moderated one of hillary clinton's senate campaign debates in 2006, said holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning. "they're hitting matt lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're — they're trying to game the system," trump told fox news last weekend. #boyfromipanema pic.twitter.com/xj5moygtpz — lester holt (@lesterholtnbc) august 13, 2016 in general, however, it is not unusual for holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. 5 things to know about presidential debate moderator lester holt "nbc nightly news" anchor lester holt will moderate the first presidential debate monday. he did say this to the chicago tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of wbbm-tv's nightly newscast: "everyone knows i'm black. he moderated a democratic primary debate holt got to practice his moderating skills at a democratic debate in january, though he split questioning duties that night with andrea mitchell. holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. he was fairly active while in rio de janeiro during nbc's coverage of the olympics, sharing images like these: scratching item off list of things i've never done before a newscast. holt left california state university-sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in san francisco. this is the person that lester sr. and june holt raised, and i make no apology for it. he says the media using criticism of matt lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode. but the rancho cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that lester jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism. trump still might find things to complain about monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make. you don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. at the same time, i'm never going to pull a race card to get what i want. "they want — and this, i think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after trump. "since then, russia has annexed crimea, fomented a war in ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support assad in syria. (sarah parnass/the washington post) time magazine checked the voter rolls in new york, and it turns out holt is actually a registered republican. he's not really into the twitter holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable. since dropping out, holt has received honorary doctorates from cal state sacramento and pepperdine university. we're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the american people. "secretary clinton, you famously handed russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009," holt said. tonight @nbcnightlynews pic.twitter.com/crmpnccpnu — lester holt (@lesterholtnbc) august 7, 2016 joining on stage for some brazilian jazz in rio tonight. holt, whom nbc declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. (he told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) and that's what they're doing by gaming the system." so you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism." we're not there to advocate on issues relating to african americans. the late abc anchor peter jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school. "lester is a democrat," trump told bill o'reilly last week. conspiratorial as trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. as president, would you hand vladimir putin a reset button?" "meet the press" anchor chuck todd never finished his studies at george washington university. but the shot he took at holt can be. his relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to trump's obsession. but he wasn’t as worried as his wife, june. "she predicted poverty and failure," he said with a laugh. "we are journalists first," carter said. it’s a very unfair system." the first debate is slated for september 26. you can't have it both ways." "it’s a phony system. they are all democrats. i am who i am. "that's a huge distinction. things worked out okay. beach volleyball.
because even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and i'll give it to you, maybe even an "obsession" or "compulsion" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed ocd comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. my ocd has affected me for as long as i can remember -- and although it's now managed well enough where it's not necessarily something people notice on their own (a proud accomplishment, if i do say so myself), there have been times it has been debilitating: severe anxiety; bleeding knuckles from obsessive washing; rapid weight drops from stress-related appetite loss; intricate and obscenely repetitive bedtime routines. but unless you are educated on the disorder, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- i'm going to be honest and let you know i really, really don't want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis. and don't get me wrong, i'm happy to explain it to you -- but i would much rather do so in response to a question or genuine interest, not a backhanded attempt at empathy. now, i know this isn't your intention, and i try to keep this in mind as i grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing. for my disorder, it's a response that i would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. but please, take this route instead of attempting to relate in a way that, unless you actually have diagnosed ocd, you would never be able to. i know you don't mean to come off as both uneducated and insensitive, so please, don't respond as if you are. the one thing you should never say to someone w/ ocd i get it -- knowing how to respond to someone's disorder or disease can be tough. i'm happy to explain this to you, to answer any and all questions -- anyone who knows me knows i'm not exactly a shy or private person. i'm one of those people who gets uncomfortable extremely easily, so i have sympathy for people that look similarly awkward when it comes up that i have obsessive compulsive disorder. i also get the desire to not only sympathize, but to empathize by finding some way to relate to this very important, and often dominating, part of my life. it shows a serious lack of understanding of what ocd is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying "oh, we all have that! which is the only reason i can assume that i hear this (or some version of this) response so often: "omg same! now, it's not always color-coding closets -- it could be anything from polishing silverware, to double-checking locks, to eating the same thing every day for breakfast. here's why: it's insensitive to diminish ocd to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. and yes, ocd symptoms present both in a variety of ways as well as varying degrees. thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish. i keep my closet perfectly color-coded!" it's not that big of a deal."

here's vikander in croft's iconic gray tank top and cargo pants, ready to fight any haters in the woods: the synopsis, according to a press release, finds lara struggling to find herself and dealing with her father's death: lara croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for lara, who—against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit—must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of japan. determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone. now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy east london as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. 2001's lara croft: tomb raider starring angelina jolie is now older than many sentient moviegoers, so the beloved video game series was due for a reboot any day. if she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider. in warner bros.' 2018 take on tomb raider, oscar winner alicia vikander embodies the title role, and she looks fierce as hell. but her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. tomb raider hits theaters in march 2018. it's the golden age for reimagining adaptations that have already happened. the first photos from the reboot are here.

as for what is arguably the most-famous "ma'am-ing" in pop culture, it turns out that the "just the facts, ma'am" widely attributed to joe friday in the popular series "dragnet" may not have actually been those precise words. much has been written about the use of "ma'am" -- kids in the south are raised using the word as a term of respect -- but still the word sometimes makes us wince. huff/post 50 asked facebook fans their thoughts on being called "ma'am" and here's what they had to say: barbara hoppenfeld said, it makes her feel "ancient." taking note of her own southern roots, nancee jenne said she sees "ma'am" as "a sign of respect," a term she said she uses "frequently." those who keep track of such things say friday's catch-phrase was actually, "all we want are the facts, ma'am." we're not sure why, except that it makes us feel old -- or, at the very least, older than the person calling us "ma'am." martha huebert added, "when you get to my age, you are so happy to be offered a seat you don't care if they call you 'hey you'." she was fine with it and told them that "their job is getting grandma back on the boat after a dive!" she added, "i don't like to be called ma'am at all. the four-letter word no woman wants to hear there are few words that trigger such a vehement reaction among midlifers than "ma'am." beth greenshields courrau said she finds the term "polite" and adds, "considering the lack of manners these days, i'm not going to worry about it. pam williams had what might be the best solution of all: "want to be liked?" let us know your views on being called "ma'am" in the comments below.

this big step in development is a big deal, becaus mars 2020 is the first step in what could be a multi-mission campaign to return martian rocks and soil to earth, and would be a big milestone in nasa’s mission to understand mars better and whether life ever existed. "the mars 2020 rover is the first step in a potential multi-mission campaign to return carefully selected and sealed samples of martian rocks and soil to earth," said geoffrey yoder, acting associate administrator of nasa’s science mission directorate in washington. "this mission marks a significant milestone in nasa’s journey to mars — to determine whether life has ever existed on mars, and to advance our goal of sending humans to the red planet." during its time on mars, it will search for past life on mars and collect samples that could eventually be returned to earth in a later mission, according to a nasa statement. nasa announced that it is ready to proceed with the final design and construction of mars 2020, scheduled to launch in the summer of 2020 and land on mars in february 2021. nasa has just made a major announcement: its next mars rover, dubbed mars 2020, has cleared a massive hurdle that could see it speeding toward the red planet in just a few years. nasa just announced something big in just a few years, it will settle down in the soil of the red planet to begin its journey. the mars 2020 rover will be built in a similar fashion to the curiosity rover, which weighs about one ton and rides on six wheels with a suite of instruments for conducting scientific analysis. the instruments on the mars 2020 rover will be different, including the mars in-situ resource utilization experiment (moxie), which may demonstrate a way to produce oxygen from carbon dioxide gas to allow future astronauts to breathe the martian atmosphere. it is also an important step to sending humans to mars years later.
you can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models — like the buick lesabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right): in the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. one of the earliest, most well-known examples is the porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963: this aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in europe and in the us, where they arrived as imports. why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s look at a photo of a street scene from the '70s or early '80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. "they all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy," says larry edsall, the author of several books on car design history. in the us, ford designer jack telnack — who'd worked on the company's european design team before taking over north american design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. designer uwe bahnsen did it first in europe with the 1982 ford sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era: reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the "jelly mould"), and the car did not sell well at first. this underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most us cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. it turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: european style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes. and inevitably, writes historian david gartman in auto opium: a social history of american automobile design, "american automakers began to copy the european aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers." verge video: this is the driverless future mercedes benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030 verge video: this is the driverless future mercedes benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030 verge video: this is the driverless future mercedes benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030 technology made it easier to produce curves a few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier. "one ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. while automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the us had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon. in europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says penny sparke, author of a century of car design. one thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today. it all started with european luxury designs by the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea — it had just largely gone out of fashion among us automakers. but its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s — and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 ford taurus. the look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 taurus: it might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. in the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like porsche, bmw, audi, and mercedes-benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors. automakers had to improve fuel economy part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars. within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic taurus. you can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the scion xb. "it's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood," sparke says. ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. the taurus, writes gartman, "was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the bmw appealed." the streamliners of the 1930s, such as the chrysler airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance. the car was even used in the movie robocop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. right as the taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with corporate average fuel economy standards for the first time. this means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed. manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before. curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. they were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. the taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat american cars. for decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. but the airflow and other streamlined american models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. through the 1970s, almost every american-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. as a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. people's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads. his 1983 ford thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. during the 1980s, they began using computer models. "they gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves." increase for almost nothing," gartman writes. most of the buildings are similar. why the big shift? sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. the strategy worked.
invest wisely: don’t invest in anything unless you are prepared to put at least 10 per cent of your net worth into it: some people invest in lots of little things with the belief that it might be a good investment, but when it comes down to it are not that sure. so before investing a little into something, don’t ask yourself can you afford to lose this small amount, ask if this is something you would actually be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into. the money-making secrets that rich people swear by millionaires may be a rare breed but their secrets to abundant wealth are actually a lot more straightforward than you might think. from how you invest to ensuring you charge your friends for your time, he shares the ultimate money-making secrets - and how the rich have used them to their advantage. if you are not confident enough to be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into it, then avoid it. avoid becoming a busy fool: it is very easy to become very busy doing things that are a huge drain on time but have little or no end value. know the value of your time: whilst it's important to help our friends, rich people know the value of their time. so, if you are skilled in a certain area, charge people for it - and they will actually be willing to pay. money expert alan andrews of kis finance has revealed the very simple rules that rich people swear by for making - and maintaining - their wealth. save, save, save: multi-millionaire sophia amoruso, founder of nasty gal, says the key to making money is saving it wisely. as warren buffet says: 'only invest in companies that can be run by a monkey, because one day it probably will be. as she explained in her autobiography #girlboss, the more time you spend saving, the more money you’ll make. if you have direct deposit, have a portion of your paycheck automatically diverted into a savings account. social says, explains, you should value what you know and start charging for it. you can’t do a good deal with a bad person.' for example, taking on too many projects that are unlikely to come to anything. it has to be paid every month, or there are consequences. it’s an emergency fund only (and vacations are not emergencies).' 'once it’s in there, forget about it. she said: 'treat your savings account like just another bill. indeed, as kim garst, founder and ceo of boom! you never saw it anyway.
this 'sad' advice a male vc just gave to women in tech couldn't be more wrong the good news is that a male venture capitalist thinks he has an innovative new solution to solve the gender gap in tech. rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are. in order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. after having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year’s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. in a column in the wall street journal, john greathouse of rincon venture partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they "create an online presence that obscures their gender." nimi katragadda , a principal at boxgroup, agreed with roizen that you can’t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was "asinine’ advice. in fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what greathouse suggested. highlighting female voices was the conference’s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority. bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both twitter and linkedin. to get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like greathouse suggests. it perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if i put my head down and just work, i will get noticed... i sat down with dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at tap , a tech conference in new york. heidi roizen , an operating partner at dfj, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. that way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn’t know if they were male or female. the fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. the topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. as a linkedin editor, i regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. "yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is." "why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?" "we know that companies that have diverse teams do better," said susanne greenfield , a director at priceline group. after becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, i suggest they own it. the bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men. "this is sad, but it is also true," said roizen. success is competency, yes, but it’s also personality and warmth." you have to do something to fight that bias." in a tweet, he apologized for the column.] people want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. "you are making the problem worse that way." [greathouse did not respond to an email i sent him requesting comment. "it’s wrong on so many levels. said angela dalton , a managing director at guggenheim. "but there is this unconscious bias. "[the column] made me really mad." she said.
if you compressed the entire history of everything, going back to the big bang, into a calendar year, all of human history would only take up just a little more than the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year. not only did they not exist at the same time, but the t. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the stegosaurus died out. it might seem like that ’70s show was made way after the end of the ’70s, but that gap is exactly the same as the gap between now and the ’90s. thanks to a boom in population growth following advances in technology and medicine, the current human population living on earth right now is about 6% of the entire human population in the entire history of the planet. if they made a that ’90s show and waited the same amount of time after the decade as that ’70s show waited after the ’70s, the show would be made in 2017. pluto didn’t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet. cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 bce, while the great pyramid of giza was completed around 2560 bce. even in its earlier years, the roman empire was still further removed from the construction of the great pyramid than they are from us. it was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before isaac newton published his principia mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. since moby dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book. lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including lyon tyler jr. and harrison tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties. if the history of the universe were placed on a calendar year, humans would only exist starting around 11:59 p.m. on dec. 31. cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of snapchat than to the construction of the great pyramid at giza. in fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn’t until about 1560 bce. since it takes about 50 milliseconds for visual information to process in your brain, by the time you actually "see" something, it happened in the past. though they’re often thought of as having lived in very different times, anne frank, barbara walters, and mlk jr. were all born in 1929. what you might not know is that nintendo started out as a playing card company, and was founded in the same year. the oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the us constitution than to today. the final execution by guillotine in france occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of hamida djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. 23 facts that will totally fuck with your perception of time um, so, oxford university is older than the aztecs. the berlin wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year. the ottoman empire was founded around the year 1300, but it lasted all the way until 1922. some of the world’s whales that are alive today were born before moby-dick was written. that means it didn’t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet. we made it to the moon only 66 years after the wright brothers invented human flight. when the first star wars movie came out, france was still executing people by guillotine. oh, and the stegosaurus was older to the tyrannosaurus rex than the t. rex is to us. the wright brothers’ first flight was in 1903, and the apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. will smith is now older than james avery (uncle phil) was when fresh prince of bel-air started. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the berlin wall than to today. while not nearly as old as oxford, harvard is still an old university. harvard university was founded before isaac newton published his laws of motion and gravity. because of its distance from the sun, pluto takes 248 earth-years to orbit the sun just once. most people know that the eiffel tower was inaugurated for the 1889 world’s fair. anne frank, martin luther king jr., and barbara walters were all born in the same year. also, the great pyramid was older to the romans than the romans are to us. when the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the oregon trail. more than 6% of all humans who have ever lived are alive today. that’s 112 years after the signing of the constitution, which was signed in 1787. by most accounts, the aztecs didn’t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century. not sure how it’s even possible, but will smith is now 48 years old. the eiffel tower was inaugurated the same year nintendo was founded. woolly mammoths were still alive when the great pyramid at giza was built. emma morano-martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. oxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. that was the same year the first star wars movie hit theaters. some bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. speaking of 1922, that’s the year betty white was born. that’s a difference of more than 2,500 years. everything you see happened in the past, not the present. pluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in flagstaff, arizona, back in 1930. the ottoman empire still existed when paramount studios was founded. by contrast, the first commercially produced, automatically sliced loaves of bread weren’t made until 1928. there’s so much americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with russia. james avery was 45 when fresh prince premiered back in 1990. the 10th president of the united states has two grandchildren who are alive today. just two years later, scottish inventor alexander bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine. paramount was founded 10 years earlier in 1912. oxford university is older than the aztec civilization. john tyler had a son, lyon tyler, at age 63. the first major wagon train hit the oregon trail in 1841. betty white is older than sliced bread. it was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. this was famously outlined by carl sagan in cosmos. 2. the aztecs. 23. 1. 6. 11. 9. 10. 12. 7. 21. 4. 14. 17. 15. 22. 19. 8. 13. 18. 16. 20.

in a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships. but they do suggest that, if you're a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn't hesitate to flaunt the fact that you're an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week. from being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women — especially if you're looking to land a long-term relationship. scientists say this behavior can make men more attractive to women scores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isn't just about the way you look. both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships — but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did. perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. a growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don't. one man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person. all the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship. in a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men. unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism. when it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men. some of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive. the women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive. more recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks. each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. for example: "two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe." second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. first, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men. about 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. it could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there. other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as "loves chinese food." it's hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. the researchers walked away with several key findings.
aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said anna peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the university of florida and the author of being animal: beasts and boundaries in nature ethics. while these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. the issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in india’s kaziranga national park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park. one way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. "essentially, regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death," she said. "the just war theory," she said, "lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?" "we’re pretty horrified by the situation," said sophie grig, senior campaigner at survival international, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons. "if you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are," she said. she added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. at the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants. "there should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals," she said. more broadly, peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. she pointed to ethicist tom regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. "it seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation." over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for world ranger day. "we have that debate here about florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators," she said. she said the "current militarized approach" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. annette hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the global initiative against transnational organized crime, echoed those sentiments. finally, peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. if we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. the numbers add up: between 2011 and 2015, rangers at south africa’s kruger national park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers. this ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. "i think this is something we need to be discussing," she said. "if you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions." protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business. some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. "rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances," grig said. is it ethical to kill poachers? grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. no one has easy answers.
plenty are sexual, with one woman admitting she misses 'hooking up with strangers' and a husband lamenting his lack of a sex life - although one woman says she regrets becoming a wife because her husband treats her 'like a sex toy'. others are more emotional, as one wife admits she's 'in love with another man', and one husband insists his wife is simply 'taking advantage of her'. one woman may simply regret the fact that she married a man, as she confesses: 'i think i'm a lesbian.' people confess the reasons they regret getting married for many people, getting married is both the happiest day of their life and the best decision they've ever made. however others sorely regret saying 'i do', with reasons ranging from the selfish to the truly heartbreaking. one upset person said their spouse 'no longer shows any love', adding: 'my heart hurts.'

how ai could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined it’s an experience many shoppers have had: you’re queued in line at the store prepared to make a purchase only to have your credit card declined for no apparent reason. that’s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. while most in the industry think ai holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report ray co-authored in august. paypal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. "there’s a magnitude of difference — you’ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated," paypal’s senior director of global risk and data sciences, hui wang, told american banker. but visa, mastercard and paypal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said celent analyst arin ray. for example, the system might detect that you haven’t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. "we can look at that transaction and, knowing what we’ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad," nelsen said. the volume of data and the speed at which it’s processed have increased considerably over that time, said mark nelsen, the company’s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. it’s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience. each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer’s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. citing a survey from javelin advisory services, mastercard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the united states in 2014 — well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. mastercard’s new decision intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. "for this to work we need all kinds of data coming in," said ajay bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at mastercard. visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases. the volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it]," ray said in an interview. "the concept of ai has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. mastercard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. financial institutions have for years collected data on customers’ habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate. the system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. with a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives," said todd marlin, a principal in ernst & young’s forensic technology and discovery services practice. since it’s still unproven technology, they don’t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure," he said. machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. the system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision. the company called it "the first use of ai being implemented on a global scale directly on the mastercard network." "we’ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network. a perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise. that’s a large sum of money that retailers — and credit card purveyors like mastercard — could be pocketing. "what we’re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence," marlin said. for the last decade, visa has deployed its visa advanced authorization system to detect fraud. digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. "we are embedding ai in everything we’re looking at as a company." "one [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations. "we see this as a critical component of our future strategy," bhalla added. "the old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules.
yup, well we all get it, and here's why: scishow has revealed that the mysterious eye gunk is actually a build up of mucus, bacteria, dust, dirt, and dead skin cells - that collect in the corner of your eyes when you sleep. but when we sleep, our blinking stops, meaning the build up of gunk in our eyes often collects in the corners and ta-daaa: an eye booger is born. people who suffer from allergies or sensitive eyes often have more gloopy and wet eye gunk, as they rub their eyes more and produce more mucus, where as dry eyes produce more of a crumbly, crusty clump - but everyone gets a bit, and it's totally normal. you know, that gunk that you wake up with that's all crusty and gross in the corner of your eye? here's why we wake up with gross eye gunk in the morning beyonce failed to mention that waking up flawless often comes hand-in-hand with the odd eye booger. basically, when we're awake (and blinking lots) each blink wipes away the build up of mucus, bacteria and dust - keeping eyes fresh. watch the video below where the sciencey-folk at scishow explain more: watch the video below where the sciencey-folk at scishow explain more: intrigued? intrigued? niiiice.
a bully pours super glue in her hair, but what she does next shocks them all... one day, 15-year-old hannah combs was talking outside of harker heights high school with friends. hannah combs was talking outside of school with friends one day when a bully came up from behind her and poured super glue on her hair. "i’m not going to pull my daughter out and uproot her from her life because of what this kid did to her," christian said. although hannah was taken to the nurse’s office, it was only when christian took her to urgent care that she was diagnosed with first degree burns. when it comes to bullying, i stand up for people a lot because of it — but it’s worth it. her hair had to be shaved on one side, so i made the best of a bad situation," nikki said. although she had been bullied before, hannah had just begun her freshman year of high school. a boy came up from behind her and poured super glue all over her hair and scalp. "there are people who couldn’t stand up for themselves but they talk to me about it. however, when jessica started a facebook page for her daughter "justice for hannah," the support came pouring in. hannah suffered first degree burns and the boy received only an in-school suspension. hannah and her mother jessica made the decision that she would cut her hair. the bullied teen had barely begun her freshman year of high school before tragedy struck. bullying is a serious issue recently another young woman, harnaam kaur, was bullied so badly she nearly took her own life. no one deserves to be bullied — it’s not fair for anyone," she said. he gave up the opportunity to go to harker heights when he committed the act." while the school is still investigating the situation, one thing is for sure: hannah is handling it gracefully. her father, a retired soldier, christopher grimmer was furious with the lack of action taken by staff. i fixed a young girls hair who had something traumatic happen to her at school. "it makes me want to help other people," hannah said. hannah is embracing her new look and wants to use her new platform to help others. i would like people to stand up for themselves. "my hair was the only thing i liked about myself, honestly. a local hair stylist named nikki decided to clean up hannah’s hair for free. she suffered first degree burns and described the feeling as a "sun burn times 10." hannah’s father, christian grimmer believes the bully should have to transfer. "that child that did this to her, uproot his life. it’s amazing how many people are supporting me." "i realized i lost my favorite thing about me. it makes me want to help. "i’m just a normal kid with strong beliefs. "today i got to do something i’m proud of. "it instantly started burning," hannah said. see how she turned a nightmare into an incredible learning experience below! i lost it for no reason." "it felt like my head was on fire. others want to know why the police haven’t gotten involved. i loved my hair," hannah said. "i want to make a difference. he says he was reprimanded by the assistant principal. the fresh start soon became her worse nightmare. the pain lasted for days. it was devastating. it was horrible."

theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. patio furniture © provided by gobankingrates patio furniture expensive the last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until september to really drop prices on these goods, according to dealnews. keep in mind that popular stores like sears and home depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of august, according to personal finance advice website smartasset. dave shute, co-author of "the easy guide to your first walt disney world visit" recommended vising disney world between the second week of easter and the week before memorial day, mid-to-late october, any week in november other than thanksgiving, and during december up to a week before christmas. cold-weather clothing © provided by gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive in july, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into august and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. 6. iphones and ipads © provided by gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive august is a terrible time to august is a terrible time to upgrade your apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in september or october, reported dealnews. since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during august, it’s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to howmuchisit.org, it’s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. if you need to purchase a new tv before the prime season, dealnews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch tv or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. for example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during august and september, according to consumer reports. typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late august, during the week of thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. if you’re in the market for a new iphone or ipad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall. if you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in august and lasting through december, according to consumer reports. advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a "great deal" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money. consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. so you’re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. bicycles © provided by gobankingrates bicycles expensive august is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it’s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in september, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff. back-to-school supplies © provided by gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive not surprisingly, august is a big month for back-to-school shopping. you might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won’t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. the discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like target, sears and kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase. but retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins — like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to time.com. not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. televisions © provided by gobankingrates televisions expensive deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on hdtvs in august. so the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to bicycling.com. also, college students who want to upgrade the tvs or lcds in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices. this means the price on an apple device purchased in august will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. it’s an exciting time for kids, and it’s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. this means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to nasdaq.com. a great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. august is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. the site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. but if you buy before labor day, you’ll likely pay more than you would later, according to cbs news. shelves will be stocked with inexpensive "loss leaders," like pencils and paper to get you in the door. 8 things that will be more expensive next month 1. another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts.

other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers martha j. bailey and thomas a. diprete, in a new essay, call "five decades of remarkable but slowing change" for american women. the rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the russell sage foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. that, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the american economy and society: women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. then there is the election, which complicates the fed’s task in two ways: policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. a rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by "pre-market" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. and even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called stem fields. girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. moreover, the "motherhood penalty" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. if you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour. that suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. a report from the bureau of labor statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in july, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. why women are no longer catching up to men on pay if you were an american man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). bailey and diprete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the russell sage foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. more recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: in 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade. the olympic tax speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast simone biles and other olympic medalists will face when they get back from rio. government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far. men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. but that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average). still, the overall picture painted by the russell sage foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. in 1964, according to data from the census bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. the fed newly released minutes from the federal reserve’s july meeting this week suggest that board chair janet yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in september or wait until the economy improves further. the u.s. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers. so as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. number of the week back in july, i wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. and in the case of high-profile olympians such as biles and swimmer michael phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. what is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure. biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. back in july, i wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. the report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. but it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because biles and other olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. but overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. culture is changing, too: men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal. rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. the average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. and of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. separate comments from key fed officials this week indicated that new data since the fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question. the job market continues to show strength; may’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. but the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. by the time biles cashes all those checks from procter & gamble, her olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error. most economists still think the fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates. the u.s. olympics committee awards bonuses to american medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. and the overall rate of "occupational desegregation" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed. (these calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) the gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. hillary clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off. a bipartisan bill to exempt olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in congress. the russell sage foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. (the medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. the bbc estimated biles will owe more than $40,000. (the pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) but the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. it isn’t a simple story. the fed is in a tricky spot. there are some encouraging signs for women. take the long-hours anecdote i described above. notice that i said "men."

she adopted this cat from the humane society but had no idea he could do this jingee is a 12 year old cat who was found outside of the toronto human society back in may. the human society has been looking for a home for jingee since may, sending out a video on facebook to try and find someone to love this cat. i saw jingee on the facebook page as a cat in desperate need of love and a home. he was old and sick and deserved a chance to live out his golden years in a home filled with love. toronto resident, hayley greenberg, saw the video on facebook and knew she had to have him. he was listed as a stray with no information, but clearly he was taught to be toilet trained. apparently somewhere along his history, jingee's previous owners had taught him how to use the toilet instead of a litter box. i knew i would be taking on future medical costs, but it was worth it to give him a new life." she ignored it, but after hearing the sound a few more nights she decided to go see what it was. after having jingee for 2 weeks, hayley heard what she thought was running water in the middle of the night. the shelter took him in and he's been looking for a forever home ever since. jingee has no tail and no teeth, making him rather undesirable to families looking to adopt. hayley went to see jingee with her daughter, lily, who immediately fell in love with him. "we had just put our last cat down and needed a new friend in our family. "apparently cats need to be trained to do this. it came as a shock to hayley, that's for sure. he was considered "unadoptable" but i couldn't just leave him there. now if only jingee could learn how to flush... now if only jingee could learn how to flush... it's actually kinda fascinating, makes you wonder," she said. makes you wonder about his past history! they adopted jingee that night. he also has fiv (feline immunodeficiency virus) which can turn a lot of people away. she definitely wasn't expecting this. jingee was potty trained!
in fact, polls routinely show that a majority of americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by house republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence. the conservative pundit blasted house republicans as "sell outs" in a column on wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing latino population will "wreck the country." coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by pew, gallup, latino decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average u.s. citizen. she argues that latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly asians, are so liberal on issues including obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they’ll never vote in large numbers for republicans. to back her assertions, coulter cites a study by phyllis schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the republicans to keep their party as white as possible. avoiding the approach advocated by folks like coulter or schlafly, he spoke some spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against latinos during interviews with the media. coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: "the only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people." "the people that republicans ought to reach out to are white voters," schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show focus today. many observers have concluded that the republican party would perform better among latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like coulter. instead, coulter has argued since barack obama’s reelection as president in november that republicans should ignore the country’s largest ethnic minority altogether. the study was not provided in the column, so it’s not clear what new information it contained. "leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed americans," coulter writes. casting aside conventional wisdom, coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the republican party lose voters. coulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was "too important to wait." "there is not any evidence at all that these hispanics coming in from mexico will vote republican. "what does it mean for the republican party?" @anncoulter won't stop ranting about this ann coulter can’t stop raging against hispanic voters. former president george w. bush pulled 44 percent of the latino vote in 2004. actually, there is.
berkeley county deputy solicitor bryan alfaro said the prosecution would continue pursuing the case, given loftis’s inconsistent accounts of whether the men forced their way into the home or whether he let them in — a crucial part of his defense, according to the post and courier, because of south carolina’s "stand your ground" law, which grants protection to homeowners who use deadly force against intruders. on monday, his lawyer argued that loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, on monday, his lawyer argued that loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the post and courier . an attorney for george zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told cnn that they had weighed florida’s stand-your-ground law before finding zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old trayvon martin. why a south carolina man got bail after he shot, buried and ‘slow-cooked’ two people early in the morning on march 5, james edward loftis found himself facing two men in his south carolina home. if and when loftis posts his $250,000 bail — probably this week, the post and courier reported — he will be on house arrest, allowed only to leave for work, church, or visits with a doctor or his lawyer, according to the post and courier. wilda loftis told the authorities that her husband was having suicidal thoughts and had told her that he had killed "them" and put "them" in the back yard, according to the original arrest-warrant affidavit. nonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old guma oz dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old james cody newland. he then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document. "i’ll get your money," he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after. stand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed african american teenager in florida. harris said what loftis did after the shooting was "heinous," according to the post and courier. "he’s a human being," defense attorney stephen harris said, according to the post and courier. gun rights advocates say such laws codify the right to protect one’s home, while opponents say they legalize the sometimes-deadly use of force. instead, the warrant said, loftis retrieved a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men. "he freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. following the brutal events that early-march morning, loftis did not call police. a prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against loftis. on monday, alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted loftis’s actions in gruesome detail. the men were demanding cab fare for the ride loftis had just received. "they were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site," he said. after police arrived, she showed them bullet holes in the living room, above the couch. investigators made their way to the backyard and discovered a disturbed patch of dirt. nobody knows how you’re going to react when you kill two people." then, they spoke to loftis, who explained what happened. his wife did.
the photograph in question was taken on us president donald trump's first day in the oval office on monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. "president trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities," said marjorie dannenfelser, president of us pro-life organisation susan anthony list. many on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 roe v. wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the us - was delivered by an all-male supreme court. on the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed "some form of punishment" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned. the order's official name is the mexico city policy because president reagan first implemented it at a united nations population conference in mexico city. republican president ronald reagan first created the mexico city policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. the policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to "neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations". he has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest. he refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement. his signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority. and while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be. although this policy does not directly affect services in the us, mr trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home. critics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning. but, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. "men making decisions about women's bodies" was a much-repeated phrase on twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author jk rowling. a group of men standing around a desk: it is not the typical image that goes viral online. the concern over lack of women at the table comes as mr trump's cabinet attracts attention for the high proportion of white, male nominations. if they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation. the roe v wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks. so here is an at-a-glance look at what president trump's executive order means. republicans and democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades. like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials. it was reinstated when president george w bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by president barack obama in 2009. is president trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding? however, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administration's swift move. is it unusual to have so many men at the table? the new us president has previously changed his mind on the issue. in an interview with cbs news, mr trump said: "the laws are set. this particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited. what has all this got to do with mexico city? is this a step towards banning abortion in the us? what are mr trump's views on abortion? viral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story. why has this photo gone viral online? this particular executive order is relevant outside of us borders. but democrats later rescinded it under the clinton administration. and why is it sometimes nicknamed the 'global gag law'? and i think we have to leave it that way." and now it is back. not in itself. no.
some people are so compulsive with their nail biting that they don’t just damage the nails, they chew past the front of the nail and eat the skin around them. when i was a kid, my parents always told me not to bite my nails, but as much as i hate to admit it, i still do it from time to time. but since i learned about the unhealthy side effects that some people experience, i’ve been able to stop cold turkey, and when you learn about it you will too. you can get infections in your fingers from the bacteria in your saliva, not to mention the wounds around your nails. people don’t think biting the skin around their nails is bad... until they learn the horrible truth. a condition called dermatophagia can be developed as a result of nail biting, and it can pose a danger to your nail bed. i know it’s a bad habit, but sometimes you just can’t help it. so if you bite your nails, stop before it’s too late! imagine if your nails looked like this for the rest of your life. in extreme situations, you can even get irreversible nerve damage. sure, it looks bad, but is it really harming anyone? in extreme cases, it can cause permanent damage. well, yes.
dr. david a. relman, a professor of medicine at stanford, wrote in an editorial commentary accompanying the initial report, "until [a type h] antitoxin can be created, shown to be effective, and deployed, both the strain itself and the [dna] sequence of this toxin ... pose serious risks to public health because of the unusually severe, widespread harm that could result from misuse of either." a new variant of botulinum toxin, "type h" is so dangerous that researchers have decided to withhold publishing information about it, over concern it could be used as a bioweapon. seven other known strains of the bacterium, labeled after the first seven letters of the alphabet, a - g, are treatable, and only four of them -- a, b, e, and f -- are actually toxic to humans. c. botulinum has long been known to produce the highly dangerous toxins, giving scientists time to develop antitoxins with which to treat them. new scientist reported that inhaling just 13 billionths of a gram of the stuff, or an injection of just 2 billionths of a gram, could kill an adult. "this is not the usual process for publishing manuscripts," dr. david hooper, an editor at the journal of infectious diseases, told npr. don't panic, but scientists have stumbled across a new substance that may be the deadliest known to man. but h type, the first new botulinum protein discovered in more than 40 years, is untreatable. fortunately, the likelihood of an average person randomly encountering the new toxin "is exceedingly small," hooper told the huffington post via email. clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that produces the toxic protein, is found in soil. of course, c. botulinum also has useful applications, ranging from neuromuscular treatments to botox for skin wrinkles. once ingested, the protein acts as a neurotoxin and can cause a life-threatening paralytic illness known as botulism. is this the world's deadliest toxin? "we thought in this case an exception was appropriate." yikes.
"we have a common interest—our families have known each other for a long time," she said of busch, whom she met on sept. 7 at the brent shapiro foundation's summer spectacular in beverly hills. former rhobh star adrienne maloof 52 explains her 24-year-old bf adrienne maloof might not have known just how young her new boyfriend, jacob busch, was when she first met him. busch is heir to the anheuser-busch fortune and the maloof family has roots in beer distribution dating back to the early 1900s, wetpaint entertainment noted. last year, maloof finalized her divorce with dr. paul nassif, a plastic surgeon whom she was married to for 10 years. on oct. 1, the new couple hit star magazine's "scene stealers" event where they promoted her vodka, zing, and engaged in some public displays of affection. "he's a lovely person and a very new friend," maloof said during an interview with "extra" last week. "both of our families have been in the spirits business for a long time. news recently about her 24-year-old beau, explaining: "when you meet someone they don't have a number on their forehead." the former "real housewives of beverly hills" star, 52, opened up to e! last month, she was linked to 30-year-old andy hnilo, owner of alitura face and body skin care, according to radaronline.com. after the split, she dated 33-year-old sean stewart, but they broke up in march. when we met we just hit it off. now, it seems she only has eyes for busch. so, he seems very familiar to me and comfortable. "our great grandfathers knew each other through the liquor industry. he's a cool guy." it felt so natural, so organic." so, we'll see.
the fact that winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the nfl and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word rape not be thrown around when addressing winston, is all smith needs to sell you on the idea of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking earth. especially in light of the year the nfl has just had (and goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that nfl teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? but the bucs desperately need a qb (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to peter king about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about winston in studying him for the draft. the nfl can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the nfl would rather not acknowledge as still existing. the friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. if aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then i wouldn’t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and i would just say fuck it and then go home and watch the aliens on tv instead. it’s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and i’m just about ready to settle into the recliner when i see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. i remember when the vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn’t get their card in on time, so i could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn’t official until the card is turned in and read. i think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it’s my bachelor party, and i should be able to do what i want, right? look at lovie smith gush about winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well: "to me, i think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it," smith said. true story: in college, i would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. my guess is that instead of straight defecation, robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. she says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold. brian: me and my girlfriend have debated this for a while, and we are both dead set in believing the other is 100 percent wrong: what’s the better time of year for sex, summer or winter? whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, i can promise you that you never want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. even if they were, you’d still grade them on a curve and have certain "hits" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. i took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. so he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop. also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the white house. i went to a basketball game last week, and i had an uber take me home, only the uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. september is the most common birth month in the united states, which means that we americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there’s nothing else to do. that strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, "don’t blame us! even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the "fuck her right in the pussy" thing. that said, if i had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the oval office for the next eight years, i’m picking elon musk. but scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. danny: if tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in america as the potus for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job? we pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. 1 no matter what, the nfl has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft. i want musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from new york to l.a. every other issue facing the country would be solved if such a water slide existed. the beatles one, because the beatles would just take the nwa lyrics and arrange some entirely new beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. the white house lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. i don’t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in january. but it is strange that, in the public scouting process, winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like "immaturity" and shit like that. if you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football iq and magical qb unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. and we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you’re willing to sit there and ride it out. so my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the beltway just as we’re getting home. pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, "bill kristol says you have nice teeth." ape chemist: suppose during the first round of the nfl draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. there are calls for obama’s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so i assume a @luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. when diddy ripped off "every breath you take" just so he could milk biggie’s death one more time, i wanted him to fall into a canyon. yes america, i helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard’s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. back in day, when i had to listen to tapes, i usually listened to all the songs on the album because i was too lazy to fast forward. i’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about johnny manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. i hate small portions, so if i eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, i feel like i just got away with something. now, your letters: dan: i don’t know if this is a good question, because i doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it. my preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. and the beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. if you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can’t hurt you at all! if i threw a party, and everyone came, and then i was like, "hey guys, this is a laundry folding party! he has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow. aaron: what happened if it came out that president obama had a twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? that’s why winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way johnny manziel’s drinking did. i pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. the truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. but he said he had really had to go, so i pull over, and it’s the same thing. i’m not saying one of his staffers was doing this—this was how barry o passed the time while on the shitter. you let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal. the beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of n.w.a’s best hits, and vice versa. and if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame winston and winston alone for it. and the only reason certain football fans enjoy mayock is because they haven’t learned to be sick of him yet.) if you haven’t turned the card in but glory boy decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him. tom: where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, i am asking that my friends just help me move. even the nuttiest white-girl beyoncé fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. i know it’s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but i don’t want a fucking actor. kevin: so i’m getting married in a month, and my fiancé and i are closing on a house next week. beyoncé could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like christmas elves. corey: let’s say all members of the beatles and n.w.a are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes. it’s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. this all takes place while the team is on the clock, so goodell has yet to announce the pick. you have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. your friend was driving, and thus he’s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. as we got close to boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. i might be wrong, but i think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. the plan was that i rent the truck, and we move everything saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk saturday night in the new house. a good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and musk and/or tim cook would more than fulfill that requirement. and i felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, i gave him $20 in cash extra. five of us were on a road trip from montreal to boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. it has to be a public figure—don’t get all sappy and say your dad, or your awesome 2nd-grade teacher. i want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for you, baby. "it’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the nfl and scrutiny is coming his way. winston was awful last season, and i’m not talking about just his "yakety sax" play in the rose bowl. (by the way, superfuck jaws and mike mayock for their little "mariota’s on top of my board now!" that tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. you’d care if you were the gm who decided to risk his job by investing the no. actually, now that i think about it, let’s choose any large park space in any other city. i need you to go away for a while so that i can grow to love you again. do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends. you take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place. i want the covers off and the lights on and i want to see everything. i hope this happens to some team like the cowboys, and jerry sends someone onstage to tackle goodell before he reaches the podium. the issue was — does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? but why do no nfl teams seem to care that jameis winston maybe raped a girl? since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. steve: this actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. william: would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes? would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo? you need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. i do think he’d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. if you want to ask your friends to help you move, that’s fine. the masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month? i thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole "eating a whole bagel" part of the enterprise. the four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. i feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn’t have dedicated aerial security. if neither player had baggage going into the draft, winston would be taken before manziel every time. i mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. my wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week. third choice would be belichick, because he’d fire everyone and then fuck every congressman’s wife. he’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell. but i swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. that’s the reason the browns are ready to give up on manziel already. it’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play. that’s what i would do if i were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. today, we’re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more. looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do." i don’t want some comedian like jon stewart or louis ck who would hate the job instantly. it’s because nfl teams think that winston is simply a better player. "if you’re lying, i’ll never stop for you to poop again." that’s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in america at the present moment. you can also order drew’s book, someone could get hurt, through his homepage. "i don’t think he’s lying this time," my wife said. the obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide. he was either lying or he got stage fright in the mcdonald’s can. my friends feel that this is selfish, and i’m taking advantage of them. i heard "back off bitch" by gnr far more times than anyone should have to endure. because central park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. i told him he could hold it until we got home. and that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. well, look, it’s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. if another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid. as much as i like nwa, i don’t wanna hear them butcher "blackbird." so i told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. blake: how many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? i would just vote for the sheep meadow in central park, dead center of manhattan. then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over. kyle: are big egg and big nutrition teaming up to push the egg white agenda? they just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any future rapes. i think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care. they constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. how are bucky brooks and daniel jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. after all, plenty of politicians out there already use twitter for trolling purposes. once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. also, i bet john lennon would really relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. we’re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. and new yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the first contact experience. it’s not like we have a ton of stuff. while celebrating, the player—like lamarr houston or bill gramatica—tears his acl. follow him on twitter @drewmagary and email him at drew@deadspin.com. but once the ginger hammer has that card, you cannot bend his iron will. they should probably make you take a test or something. it’s hot and overcrowded, and there’s horseshit everywhere. assume the team hasn’t officially announced the pick. i don’t think he’d actually resign, though. doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. you can’t keep up with that kind of catalog. no backsies, even if it hasn’t been formally announced. there are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. my clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. you have to have tunnel vision and do your job. i think you know where this is going. he did not have to take a shit. "you’re not lying this time, are you?" it’s a complete pain in the ass. what's better summer sex or winter sex? but you can’t apply that to your party credit. ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? we talked to 75 whole people about him!" i should only have to fold my clothes. these kids today never want to take responsibility smdh! how long would the media blow that up for? he threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit acc teams. i need good material for when i’m alone. the mock drafts all have him going at no. now fold my laundry and i’ll get takeout!" some of it fell out of his pants (how?) i don’t like cracking so many of them. does the nfl let the team withdraw the pick? don’t tell me it can’t be done. i used to be huge on egg whites. time for your weekly edition of the deadspin funbag. you know what’s funny about all this? he’d be way too enthusiastic about it. technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan. anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you. that doesn’t count as a celebration, you monster. all major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. i need eggs to be triple their current size. i don’t have to do that anymore. give me your top 3, and provide reasons why. look at him shake off defenders and circuit court judges with such ease! finally, america would have a putin of its own. all my friends would have me killed. those songs can’t all be great. that’s what you have to do. "you guys don’t get these aliens. would there be calls for impeachment/resignation? green shit was caked on his legs. kids don’t hide that sort of thing. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. 1 or 2 (most say no. i want everything out in the open. and he’d have so many secrets. but the yolk has all the cholesterol! what would his twitter handle be? i could a 50-egg omelet. the yolk is the best part. but that’s not a party. it’s a new york thing." the last leg was the toughest? i’m suspicious of the whole thing. jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. it’s still a lot of damn money.) that’s easy to do now. all golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... robocop has no time for poop. sponsored on the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. mike: how does robocop poop? you can’t do that. i won’t hear it. you’re asking for free manual labor instead. why are eggs so small? got something on your mind? why aren’t they even mentioning it? he’s also a correspondent for gq. because that’s too much product! which album ends up sounding better? i could hear him exhaling forcefully. but in general, this is untrue. sometimes i ate two in one sitting. but that guy shouldn’t expect it. if jameis is gonna go no. were there dragons lining the highway? he pays the ticket. switch it and draft todd gurley instead. what do you think? news crews could get there quickly. (who are we kidding? drew magary writes for deadspin. and landed on the front stoop. roasted-nut vendors would make a killing. email of the week! not their best work. and the rape stuff. how does rape not??? none of those guys could sing. i am not a crackpot. of course they care. personally, i prefer summer. my laundry is awesome. i need a visionary, man. it’s not the boozing. i say fuck that. the dog, i guess. do not do this. so i did. medal of honor for me, pleeeeeeez. i asked him. it’s not welded metal. but screw your friend. email the funbag. tell them, y&t! spiel this week. and i knew why. fuck that laundry. who is right? how the fuck?! it was everywhere. it’s quite something. "more like marco boob-io, amirite?!" i swear. that’s science. summer is sexier. it was terrifying. begged him, really. suck it, russia. crowds would form. why? 1). funbag! halftime!
"one of the things, in my view, that we get wrong in the free enterprise movement is this war against the social safety net, which is just insane," brooks said. top conservative challenges gop to "declare peace on the safety net" arthur brooks, president of the conservative think tank the american enterprise institute, is challenging republicans to reconsider their aversion to welfare programs. the top conservative considered the partisan discourse surrounding support for those who need it, saying the far left calls for endless amounts of relief, while the far right calls for enterprise. during the "right to rise: education as america’s 21st century ticket to social mobility" event, brooks recalled recent visits to "off the map" areas neglected by politicians because they're home to voters who are either certain they'll vote for them or certain they won't. "the government social safety net for the truly indigent is one of the greatest achievements of our society," said brooks. "and we somehow want to zero out food stamps or something, it’s nuts to want to be doing something like that. brooks' comments came weeks before an automatic decrease to food stamp benefits set for nov. 1, in which the average family will see a $36 cut in their benefits. after speaking with people in the areas -- "prostitutes, drug addicts, ex-felons, homeless people" -- brooks said they called for three things. we have to declare peace on the safety net." "transformation, relief and opportunity, in that order," he said.

while he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. at the start of this semester goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including jill, the automated question and answering service goel developed with the help of some of his students and ibm. goel plans to use jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human. (courtesy ashok goel) to help with his class this spring, a georgia tech professor hired jill watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. what happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant here’s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student. as goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on ibm watson, which he had used for several other projects. the system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. with more human-like interaction, goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. to train the system to answer questions correctly, goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. jill had to be almost perfect as a human ta or i am," goel said. watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions. goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether jill’s answers were correct. initially the system struggled with similar questions such as "where can i find assignment two?" throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff. now goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate. "i feel like i am part of history because of jill and this class!" "just when i wanted to nominate jill watson as an outstanding ta in the cios survey!" ashok goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams. this gave jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered. but, in fact, jill watson was an artificial intelligence bot. "to me this is a grand challenge," goel said. "education is such a huge priority for the entire human race." eventually jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants. there are many questions jill can’t handle. wrote one in the class’s online forum. goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. and "when is assignment two due?" students were amazed. "i cannot create chaos in my classroom. said another.
isaiah adams recently proposed to his girlfriend, grace, in what no doubt seemed like a picture-perfect setting: maryland’s cunningham falls. the ring was never found, but the show reported that the couple plans to get married anyway. then, in a flash, the ring was gone, falling into the cold waters below. "i was crying with happiness but then i was crying with fear at the same time. i looked up and his face was just shock," grace told "inside edition." here’s hoping adams didn’t take that two months’ salary thing too seriously. watch as a romantic waterfall wedding proposal goes horribly wrong be real careful about where you pop the question. at least they still have their love, right?
we don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. following the footprints of apple, there are many manufacturers such as oneplus, htc, meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. smartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as apple, motorola, google, htc, sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. asus manufactured the invisible band smartphone asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. the zenfone 3 series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body. antenna bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. now, this white lines trend was started by apple with the iphone 6 and 6 plus. it is worth noticing that the iphone 6 and 6 plus were heavily criticised for their design language. the trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. there are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. however, some of them look really good such as the oneplus 3, meizu mx6. the white lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'antenna bands'. in simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. according to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. they are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. instead, there are iphones with glass on front and back. ever wondered what these white lines on iphones mean? the answer to this question is a simple one. well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. we are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. you might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? what actually are those white lines? who started this? this is bit technical. are they harmful? followed by? but why? absolutely, no.

(vanity fair) when i saw the new cover, with zuckerberg in his signature grey tee and blue jeans, i wondered whether diehl had styled the cover in a genius homage to the facebook founder’s personal uniform. guess what mark zuckerberg wore on the new vanity fair cover mark zuckerberg is on the cover of the october issue of vanity fair, in a portrait taken by legendary photographer annie leibovitz. usually such a sitting would require (at least) a rack of clothing and a team of assistants led by the magazine’s fashion and style director, jessica diehl. despite diehl’s recent statement that the magazine’s cover "is not your casual-jeans tuesday" (in reference to vanity fair’s issue starring caitlyn jenner), zuckerberg’s tuesday cover suggests otherwise. in the past, he has attributed his perennial look to a desire to focus his energy on important business decisions, rather than what he characterized as "silly or frivolous" choices, such as what to wear. i pictured zuckerberg, safely protected from decision fatigue, while assistants pored over a rack of luxury approximations of his everyday grey tee. zuckerberg wore his own clothes, saving everyone involved in the cover shoot from wasting their brain capacity on fashion. in this context, nothing says power quite like telling vanity fair, "i’ll wear my own clothes. perhaps it’s fitting, as this month’s "new establishment" issue is all about power. alas, a vanity fair spokesperson has confirmed, there was no stylist for this cover, and no designers credited. (the personal uniform here becomes the fashion analog of meal-replacement beverage soylent.) it’s a look. lang or wang? armani or vince? thanks."
hbo kit harington admitted during filming he may have got a bit too in character accidentally hitting iwan not once but twice while miming his punches, according to the evening standard he said: i actually did punch iwan in the face, twice, by accident, which he took really well. it was a wonderfully cathartic moment to see the usually cocky and sneering ramsay get his just desserts but it was anything but wonderful for poor iwan rheon. that’s fair enough kit but i can’t say i didn’t smile a little when the show’s biggest bell-end since joffrey got what was coming to him. the two northerners battled in the courtyard of winterfell, after the largest and most brutal battle in thrones history, and jon ended up beating the bastard into a bloody pulp. thankfully iwan doesn’t share his characters love of skinning men alive and laughed off the accident joking: "jaw hurt a bit the next day, but, you know, it’s understandable." harington also revealed that he thinks jon goes a bit too far while beating ramsay’s face into a fine paste. hbo finally, after teasing the confrontation all season, last night’s episode of game of thrones saw jon snow face off against the vile ramsay bolton. he said: it’s a horrible moment when you see your hero go a bit too far. filming the newest game of thrones was way more brutal than it looked spoilers for season six game of thrones! he’s still getting what he deserves, this is- ok, stop. i had to buy him a pint after that one. ramsay’s getting what he deserves! he was really nice about it. the audience should feel, ‘yes! could you stop now? yes!
media caption rishworth school sent a micro bit into the stratosphere a number have told me that the micro bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - "starting after half term, it's come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures" was one comment this morning. bbc micro bit computer becomes a commercial product image caption the micro bit will be more than double the price of the raspberry pi zero mini-computer the bbc micro bit, the tiny computing device designed to get children coding, is going on sale to the general public. image caption until now, only year 7 schoolchildren in the uk had access to their own micro bits the hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join year 8 in september, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then. element 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the bbc and micro bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy. it started arriving in schools this spring and the bbc says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds). image caption owners of the micro bit can write code for it via a website designed by microsoft element 14 is part of premier farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful raspberry pi barebones computer. while i have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers. but if it does prove as good a seller as the raspberry pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more year 7 children getting their hands on one. the real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next year 7 children will benefit from getting their own micro bits. commercial availability of the micro bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device's manufacturer, the leeds-based company, element 14. the micro bit was meant to be the flagship of the bbc's make it digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. it is late in the year - although the micro bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays. the device is already being delivered, free, to one million year 7 children in schools across the uk. they could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. now it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for £12.99. the micro bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices. "we've already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who've seen what has happened in the uk." kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc." and there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again. richard curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the micro bit. the firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90. but retailers including microsoft, the technology will save us organisation and sciencescope will offer individual devices. "it's going to be huge," he told me. but another teacher said this: "got ours just before easter hols.
cliven bundy’s lawyer joel hansen told buzzfeed news that there are still cattle on the range, and that ranching operations are being run by bundy’s wife and other women in the family while the rancher awaits trial. new battle brews over bundy's cattle in the nevada desert rob mrowka, a scientist with the center for biological diversity, said the bundy cattle are essentially "feral," roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres — including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. the area occupied by the cattle is also one of the driest in the u.s., mrowka said, and the cattle end up out-competing the tortoise for limited food. "the environmentalists say that it’s bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that’s false," hansen said. bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in february at portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his nevada ranch. "the tortoises do better with the cattle on the land because they like to make a meal out of the cow pies. it’s all just environmental hype and it’s all for the purpose of getting mr. bundy out of there." "the problem is that the cattle are out there constantly and get first dibs," mrowka added. (bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.) hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat.

basically andy’s advice for getting to the top of the tinder charts seems to revolve around being handsome, charismatic and funny which, while admittedly solid advice, is about as obvious as a particularly obvious horse trying to infiltrate the hen house because he fancies a hen. andy even has some pretty solid advice about picking the photos to stick on your profile saying you want the self portrait shot, full body shot, the funny pose shot, the laughing candid shot, and finally the dog owner shot. tech insider via youtube being honest, aside some colossal issues surrounding unwarrented self-importance, andy seems like a pretty normal guy and not the raging bag of dick tips you’d expect to have mastered tinder. here's why this guy is one of tinder's most right swiped men meet andy mizrahi a 28-year-old divorcé who also happens to be the most swiped right bloke in new jersey on tinder. in an interview with tech insider (because tinder is an app i guess and it’s definitely not an attempt to boost traffic) andy laid bare the secrets to his success. not going to lie i have no idea what that means but i’m guessing it’s a good thing, my sleeves always fall down and i don’t even have tinder so there must be a correlation. time magazine also ranked him the 14th sexiest man alive because, and i quote, ‘this a guy who knows how to roll up his sleeves and get things done’.
ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by kleiner perkins caufield & byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn’t made it into the information age – billions of boxes of paper files. it’s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. ripcord’s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. the machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached. fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn’t putting people out of work, it’s going to change the way that filing work is done. all of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access. the first problem most people face when they’re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. with billions of boxes of files in storage across the u.s. alone, that’s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. this company wants to solve all your scanning and filing problems most staple removers fit in the palm of your hand. ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. the company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. ripcord’s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. that seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software. the goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. "we’re not replacing people with machines, we’re giving them much more interesting things to do," fielding said. much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. a chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer. while the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. ripcord isn’t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. ``the issue is not demand.’’ like many silicon valley start ups, ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. this one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence. "i don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover." ``we’re drowning in problem,’’ said co-founder and chief executive officer alex fielding. warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to hayward, california-based ripcord. the machines aren’t going on sale. it also stores the information for them.
in august 2012, a man in taiwan was killed after falling into a huge sinkhole in the wake of a typhoon; and that same month, an idaho woman died after crashing into a sinkhole on the highway caused by gophers. the sinkhole opened up around 12:40 a.m. friday in the city of guangyuan, shanghai is reported. 200-foot sinkhole swallows 12 buildings a sinkhole nearly 200-foot wide in china's sichuan province has swallowed at least 12 buildings and is expected to keep growing. in march, a sinkhole opened up underneath the bedroom of a sleeping florida man, swallowing him entirely. as of 6:30 p.m., the sinkhole had swallowed 12 buildings, but no one was seriously injured. many who have encounter sinkholes have not been so lucky.
antibiotic-resistant infections spread through europe 4 show all antibiotic-resistant infections spread through europe 1/4 k. pneumoniaeis one of the toughest super-infections alamy 2/4 amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by gps 3/4 antibiotic resistance cycle 4/4 antibiotic-resistant infections in europe the report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former goldman sachs asset managemet chairman lord jim o’neill. antibiotics crisis is global lord o’neill said of the findings: "my review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. lord o'neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (pa) it calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: "to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face." the actions i’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face." chancellor of the exchequer george osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: "lord o’neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. antibiotics will soon 'stop working' urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing "terrible human and economic cost", a major study has warned. among his recommendations, lord o’neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn. dame sally davies, chief medical officer for england, who previously warned that the uk is facing an "apocalyptic scenario" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as "challenging." resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. the report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050. an estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the uk every year, of which the health regulator nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions. with over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as mrsa develop. the review was commissioned by the government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the uk. they transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate." it is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. in the uk, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections.
"you wonder is it really because you have so many people," that things are delayed, bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, "he has to re-write his entire speech, since chris christie ripped it up?" and then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, "well, i'm going to say it again.... barack obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. dan, who traveled all the way to new hampshire because "this is such an intimate state where i have access to all the candidates....where i can ask the questions i want to ask." so went marco rubio's morning after, the morning after an ambien-esque nightmare of a debate performance where chris christie repeatedly pounced on him for reciting the same anti-obama talking point, nearly word for word, four times. "it's the marco rubio pancake breakfast—so far we've had no pancakes and no marco rubio," joked bob durant, a rhode island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. londonderry high school was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned rubio's now-defining line, "let's dispel with this fiction that barack obama doesn't know what he's doing. dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a rubio constituent from florida, he wondered what a president rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in miami beach underwater. two young rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an "i pledge to vote for rubio" the responses: i'm not from here. there was one very important thing missing from the marco rubio pancake breakfast: londonderry, new hampshire—three clarifications from marco rubio's pancake breakfast sunday morning. the michigan state director for the bush/quayle 1992 campaign, meg durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. "last time i heard him say it," which just happened to be in manchester two days ago, "he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait." "they waited for me to drive away," to make sure she didn't replace one of their christie signs with a bush sign. watching from a ledge behind him was kaity thomson, a recent university of new hampshire graduate, who'd come to hear rubio with her co-worker and friend yuxi wang. "i think it's a narrow band of folks who read each other on twitter," jim merrill, a rubio senior advisor for new hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. kevin mcallister, the pac's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by christie, and the opportunity was irresistible. that would be her cousin, tom stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from ohio to new hampshire two years ago. dan kipnis, who has been trying to bring marco rubio to the climate change table for nearly 10 years now. this time "he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it." durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. dan kipnis, who traveled all the way to new hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. although the beleaguered rubio campaign was quick to call it another bush dirty trick, the marco robotos were animated by operatives from democratic super pac american bridge. things perked up a little bit when rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. "nobody is," he started, and then corrected himself, "there are a few people from new hampshire." he's still going to abolish the federal department of education, but he's decided to offer tom brady "a cabinet position. not everyone—especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast—was satisfied. "there are ten of us here," she noted, "and only one of us is a new hampshire voter." "we couldn't figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people—i hope they fed you." "people just got here early," he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice. as the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, merrill's "very strong ground game" was in action. he's still undecided; his wife was for hillary clinton until she went to a clinton rally last week. when rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. "i'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground," capt. isn't there something rubio can do about climate change "for the young people?" after saturday's republican debate, she grabbed a couple of christie and bush signs for her kids. "i say, 'ok, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'" at least 50 percent of the 800 or so attendees were not new hampshire voters. thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: "the visiting captain's story ... reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause rubio some cognitive dissonance. "we were expecting pancakes," said thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. "i don't know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. his wife, meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. after bush began to founder, "i thought marco would have walked away with it. the cardboard costumed rubio-bots mechanically handing out broken gaskets were not new hampshire voters. still, she admitted, it's been difficult to predict how things are going. "i hope this morning is the marco we want to see." ... not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country." "a couple of housekeeping items," were the first words out of his mouth. i thought he was a shoo-in," when the race first got underway. he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. some christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. it hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. ok, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy capt. rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate's debate performance was getting. any slip of the gears isn't going to affect tuesday's results. there were no pancakes at the pancake breakfast. i think it was really moving and inspiring." "'well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' "thank you for making the drive," one volunteer repeatedly responded. dan professed to be happy with rubio's response. dan kipnis, member of the miami-dade county climate change advisory task force. "we're going to focus on president obama." he knows exactly what he's doing," over and over. "we have a very strong ground game." well, it won't do that either." dan kipnis, director-at-large, florida wildlife federation. gleeful scorekeeper christie called on ball three, "the memorized 25-second speech!" i'm from out of state. the better approach is to support innovators of american energy. rubio has a script for this question. but after last night..." she gave a little shrug. nobody said that," he said. now, she's undecided, too. "christie's people, they are street fighters." it didn't get better. climate change legislation hurts the economy. dan kipnis, adviser to former vice president al gore. we just came up from massachusetts. "i thought jeb had it. "there it is!" we're from connecticut. it grew a little wearying. identifying himself as capt. no, new york. "it's crazy." possibly so. but afterwards, capt. folksy capt. capt. belichick, too."
you’ll never believe how much kim kardashian’s morning skincare routine costs you’ll never believe how much kim kardashian’s morning skincare routine costs you’ll never believe how much kim kardashian’s morning skincare routine costs more we never expected kim kardashian’s at-home skincare routine to consist of run-of-the-mill products anybody could get, but a recent snapchat showed that kim surely does not play around when it comes to her morning beauty ritual. with those statements, it’s no wonder la mer is a longtime favorite of makeup artists and celebs, as well as the source of legend — mariah carey was once rumored to use la mer as diaper cream for her babies and jennifer lopez was said to have applied the stuff on her body from head to toe. while some of us might only be able to fantasize about using la mer in our own morning skincare routines, we still might be able to try another favorite of kim’s, such as kiko’s scrub & peel wipes by the italian cosmetics brand, kiko milano. according to us weekly, kim snapped a photo of four products all from the luxurious la mer brand — the perfecting treatment, the concentrate, the renewal oil, and the iconic crème de la mer. kim also made sure to say that she wasn’t getting paid for promoting the product, which can be considered more proof that la mer may very well live up to its hype. the post you’ll never believe how much kim kardashian’s morning skincare routine costs appeared first on hellogiggles. for decades, la mer has been the crème de la crème (no pun intended) when it comes to facial moisturizers. the brand’s website claims it has the power to completely "transform the skin," and making it look "virtually ageless." if you can get your hands on them, the exfoliating wipes only go for about 6 pounds, or around $8.50 usd. the total cost for this high-end skin treatment? that sounds way more doable than $1230! that’s rent money, people. could you imagine? a whopping $1,230.
but i just mean that when i enter it doesn’t feel like a star has entered. so salman and shah rukh are bigger stars than i am. when i enter feels like a waiter has entered. when salman enters it looks like a big star has entered. he is salman is a bigger star than me. i think shah rukh is a bigger star. i also feel they are bigger stars than me. if you ask me i will say that thing and if you ask salman he will say same thing. i think between myself, aamir and salman we have huge liking towards each other. i think it is out of respect. amitabh ji is a bigger star. no offense to waiters. who’s the biggest khan in bollywood?
lindsey tepe of the new america foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view american history as "a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," and those who recognize that "american history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation." and, as in the u.k. and canada, the veterans of foreign wars (vfw) distributes poppies on veterans day and memorial day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. separately, two bills have been introduced in congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on veterans day, the other to do the same on memorial day. in this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement. one potential explanation lies in the fact that the u.s. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the first and second world wars brought to britain and russia, respectively. the numbers don’t lie, though: according to the vfw, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the u.s. (population: 316 million) this year. by comparison, u.s. losses in the second world war constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the first world war. when america’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. jay winter of yale university told me that those men "left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there." a debate is also underway about what america’s global role should be, with many americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular u.s. foreign policy following isis’s beheading of american journalists). in communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. on memorial day, some people observe the national one-minute moment of remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by congress in 2000. from 1989 until his passing in 2012, senator daniel inouye of hawaii, a world war ii veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return memorial day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. during the second world war, the united states fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. joe davis, director of public affairs at the vfw, believes the all-volunteer force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. by comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the u.k. (population: 64 million) for armistice day, according to the royal british legion. winter argues that "what makes u.s. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in american narratives of war." davis also cited as a factor the shifting of memorial day from its original, fixed date of may 30 to the last monday of may. it should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of decoration day, the precursor of memorial day. today, the professional military is well below its troop level during world war ii, and the u.s. population has more than doubled in the interim. the only american war that incurred such steep losses was the civil war, in which 2 percent of the population perished. in the united states, at least, they may also stem from a strain of american thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. neither bill has been passed, although the one for veterans day has since been revised as an amendment to the national defense authorization act. judging by recent polls, the american public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in iraq and afghanistan were failures. "what makes u.s. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war." in the u.k., on the other hand, "the absence of the lost generation mattered more." the soviet union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the second world war—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the great war, resulting in a "lost generation." "when you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day," davis told me. differences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate america’s war casualties has been noted. observation of the moment is left up to participating organizations, such as amtrak and major league baseball. all this isn’t to suggest that americans never mark veterans day and memorial day. is there a better way to observe veteran's day? why doesn’t the united states have a common culture of commemoration? the finer details make a difference as well. the timing of these bills is opportune.
don’t rely on previous salaries if women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries. (as the actress jennifer lawrence wrote in lenny after the sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn’t fight for more because "i didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’ ") one solution, ms. babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. "if a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that’s not the same as making a career choice," said philip cohen, a sociologist at the university of maryland. it says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal equal pay act requires. because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, ms. babcock found. when receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of carnegie mellon university graduate students by linda babcock, an economist at the university. in august, the federal office of personnel management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee’s previous salary when setting his or her new one. sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. in states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found. women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits. build more flexible workplaces ms. goldin of harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. the gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. but her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. make work easier for mothers research has found that salaries at men and women’s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. proposed federal legislation known as the paycheck fairness act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier. "we put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay," ms. pao wrote in the hollywood reporter. marc benioff, the c.e.o of salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women’s salaries equal to men’s. another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations. social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces. in other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested. to negotiate, or not men are paid more partly because they’re much more likely to ask for it. "don’t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination," ms. babcock said. alexandre mas, an economist at princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 california law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. jake rosenfeld, a sociologist at washington university, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees’ arguments in wage bargaining. policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors. "one thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers." change the law federal law doesn’t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics. google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth. in a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient. publish everyone’s pay when employers publish people’s salaries, the pay gap shrinks. that has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. the gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children. kimberly-clark and pricewaterhousecoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions. the acting director, beth cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. "even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms," he said. companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. other american companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately. sometimes their employers assume they’ll do so, even if they don’t. a few european countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. the strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in california this month. that is what ellen pao did when she was chief executive of reddit. ideas about how to bridge the gender gap on pay. "i think that is the most effective thing organizations can do." then, women aren’t penalized as much for working fewer hours. the california law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay. president obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the labor department. the company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers. so what might work to close the gap? but that legislation is stalled in congress. it prompted pay cuts, but only among men. another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely.
we compared traffic data from that same french news publisher with a top-10 french sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. there were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing. firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in south america, france and the u.k., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher. it’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. we looked at 220,000 facebook posts made by our publisher clients between march 20 and july 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. overall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. as can be seen in the above chart, the south american publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. we also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 french news publishers. even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content. again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day. the british and french publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times. using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal "best times" to share content on facebook. could it be that readers in france all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the south americans? coschedule, fast company, hubspot, shortstack, forbes, hootsuite, quicksprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as "when is the best time to post on facebook?" by early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough. indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists. there’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts. one explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns. all shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume. to get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers. the natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on facebook. however, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. we then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. we analyzed the median traffic that articles received from facebook three hours after they were shared. but even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. when's the best time to share on facebook? interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. and "how often should you post stories on facebook?" can there be specific guides per country? featured image: nick shepherd/getty images featured image: nick shepherd/getty images featured image: nick shepherd/getty images our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.
here is the world's ugliest color (& it has an important job) — design news we spend a lot of time talking about color, often in the context of how to pick a paint hue or how it can make you happier. the australian government hired research agency gfk to redesign cigarette packaging in 2012, and they determined (with seven studies and 1,000 regular smokers) that this was the most deterring color to pair with the anti-smoking graphics. but one research firm discovered what they're calling the world's ugliest color, which has been described as "dirty" and "death." other colors in the running were lime green, white, beige, dark gray, and mustard, with dark brown coming in second (but was deemed too chocolatey). pantone 448 c, or "opaque couché" is a greenish brown-gray that looks like it spent a few decades in a sewer. if you find it unpleasant, that's the point.
it started with, of all things, a job doing manual labor for the then-more-successful actor in an upcoming episode of bbc’s, grammer reveals the odd way in which his penchant for backstage tony bennett impressions circuitously led toco-creator sam simon offering him the role. it started with, of all things, a job doing manual labor for the then-more-successful actor ellis rabb "when i was working for him i was painting his bathroom and hanging wallpaper ... "ellis would regale me with stories when he came home from work always, and he’d say things like this: ‘oooh, kelsey. the graham norton show, grammer reveals the odd way in which his penchant for backstage tony bennett impressions circuitously led to simpsons co-creator sam simon offering him the role. "and i thought, ‘this guy—i’m gonna use him someday.’ and when i read the script for sideshow bob, i said, ‘this is ellis rabb.’" really, though, this is a story that can’t be done justice in text. kelsey grammer reveals the secret origin of sideshow bob’s voice simpsons characters who are not voiced by main cast members, criminal mastermind and pompous of all the recurringcharacters who are not voiced by main cast members, criminal mastermind and pompous slapstick victim sideshow bob is a strong contender for the most beloved. even more interesting is the way that the actor explains how he came up with bob’s grandiose manner of speaking. imbued with the honeyed baritone strains of kelsey grammer’s vocal cords, krusty the clown’s fallen comic foil is a continuously welcome source of bathos on the long-running animated show. you really need to hear grammer deliver this anecdote, upon which he’s clearly been dining for decades: send your newswire tips to tips@avclub.com send your newswire tips to tips@avclub.com send your newswire tips to tips@avclub.com that baby should have been mine,’" grammer explained to norton, slipping in and out of his former boss’s distinctly flamboyant voice.
he has died in the wild and the willing, sinful davey, a man for all seasons, 10 rillington place, the ghoul east of elephant rock, spectre, alien, the elephant man, heaven’s gate, the osterman weekend, the hit, after darkness, the black cauldron, jake speed, spaceballs, aria, deadline, little sweetheart, scandal, l’oeil qui ment, monolith, even cowgirls get the blues, contact, the climb, all the little animals, you’re dead, lost souls, hellboy, pride, tabloid, the proposition, v for vendetta, outlander, boxes, an englishman in new york, ultramarines, whistle and i’ll come to you, tinker tailor soldier spy, only lovers left alive, snowpiercer, hercules, and finally the tv miniseries i, claudius. if we do that, sean bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with bela lugosi, and followed closely by mickey rourke and john hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. of course, bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to lugosi, price, and hurt). he’s been dropped from a satellite dish in goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in the island, peppered with arrows in the lord of the rings, and decapitated in game of thrones. with over 120 movies, hurt’s death percentage is similar to bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive. but with the number of sean bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective. in the years to come, we could see boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene. while bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films. however, even though bean has perfected his "i’m dying" face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. but the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor john hurt. actor sean bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. * it looks like the "walking spoiler" meme has a grain of truth to it. two legendary horror actors, vincent prince and bela lugosi, each outpace bean by at least 10 movies. *updated: this post originally missed hurt’s three most recent movie deaths and now includes more actors in the graph (thanks commenters)! for that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. vincent price and cary tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. does sean bean really die more than other actors? so is sean bean a walking spoiler alert? (for the curious: south park‘s kenny barely beats bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.) and a hat tip to biologist josh witten for suggesting the deaths/film metric. so where does sean bean fall along this list? a long enough career can rack up the kills. for example, robert de niro has died on screen 19 times. i crafted the following chart to find out: click to enlarge! other stars like leonardo dicaprio have died 9 times. kyle hill is the science editor of nerdist industries. maybe it should be #dontkilljohnhurt. follow on twitter @sci_phile. one does not simply... assume.
here's what they did say to our producer will: we are sorry we will not support your production because we are christians and we believe the first marriage god instigated was between and [sic] man and a woman and when he created them he said "very good", not just "good" like he did with the rest of creation, but "very good". as we prepare to open our production of god hates this show: shirley phelps-roper in concert live from hell in new york city next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the westboro baptist church and shirley phelps-roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity. mankind has moved so far from the way god intended us to live, we must return to god's way of living, it is the best way and the blessed way, hope you can understand. and rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, ruby decided to do the least christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. but the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for ruby and ivory & deene to turn their heads the other way. impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. we thought that the worst thing they could say was "no," but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. the truth is, ruby can't be naïve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. god hates this show: shirley phelps-roper in concert live from hell runs oct. 16-20 at here in new york city. kind regards, ruby punctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. to them, a chandelier is a holy object ordained by god to illuminate the rooms of only those who seek his approval and judgment. after all, they are grandiose and self-righteous in a way that only a person with great power and questionable taste could truly appreciate. it seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show. consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes. perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from ruby and hang it proudly on our set. to find out if you yourself are fit to own these fine straight-people products, ask yourself this: "do i like gay sex?" i also have a full page of ad space that i don't know what to do with. she seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. (god did not say "very good" when he created man and woman. whether she knows it or not, ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. maybe this: the chandelier in tonight's performance comes from ivory & deene's collection of exquisite heteronormative lighting. this question might also help you determine whether or not you'll dig our show. and in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. this company seems to think so something tells me that god loves a good chandelier. only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue. our hunt led us to the lovely, christian businesspeople at ivory & deene. she may not have called us "faggots," but she might as well have. we're screwing on your sheet sets, ruby. she seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the bible. just thought you'd like to know. (if you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) god hates gays...who own chandeliers? and the folks over at ivory & deene home furnishings completely concur. what did we have to lose? hope to see you there. there will be chandeliers. you're gay by association. i mean, come on. i worry about ruby. girl is selling amazing satin sheets. find a shower. for more information, visit godhatesthisshow.com. look it up.) quick.

no one had ever done anything like that for me so it made me cry and i'm not really the type to show my emotions no one had ever done anything like that for me so it made me cry and i'm not really the type to show my emotions no one had ever done anything like that for me so it made me cry and i'm not really the type to show my emotions this teenager used to walk miles to work to take care of his mother, then everything changed derrick taylor works at a ups centre five miles from his home, where he loads and unloads vans with packages. the 19-year-has been working since he was 14 to pay the bills and look after his sick mother, according to the daily mail. as he was presented the car, his colleague said he wanted taylor to know everyone appreciated his "hard work". taylor says he was too proud to ask for lifts from his co-workers. that was, until his co-workers clubbed together and bought one for him. oh, and he had to walk to work and back. taylor told the mail: i was overwhelmed with joy. taylor had a driving license, but couldn't afford a car. and he starts work at 4am.
and though i didn't typically look at my phone, once i set up the rule that i would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait. and though it was a place that was all my own -- where i could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself. my boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and i had just decided to check my email. i’ve been taking ballet all my life since i was very young, and while i did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. in this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way. to me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. but one time i did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. the one place this google executive won't take her phone is there one place you choose to honor with your full attention? as an undergraduate [at howard university], at harvard business school, and as i moved to different cities -- denver, boston, detroit, new york -- i'd always find a ballet studio. from the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. that one email check pulled into class what i should be doing after class. email draws you in and there’s always some action item -- something that triggers a response. for the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. the truth is, that during class, i never looked at my phone. so there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) and something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. it just brings me so much joy to dance. everyone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. i realized that i had invaded my sacred space with technology. i lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. our "sacred spaces" series explores where your phone is unwelcome. this interview was edited and condensed for space and clarity. bonita stewart is vice president of partner business solutions at google. it became this sacred space. who are there with me. remembering the exercise, going across the floor. want to share your own? as told to meredith melnick. send us your story here.
it includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. if you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. but sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past. they'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell. no matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently. you can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. but many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it. becoming sales intelligent modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages. they may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. when people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. salesforcevoice: 3 ways to make your company more sales intelligent you've heard of street smarts and book smarts. sales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. you most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their crms, and schedule drip campaigns. the better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. if you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. what obstacles are preventing you from embracing these tools, and what would inspire more confidence in them? the greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization. the big questions with new tools are always: how much will this cost? a few years ago, they would have used simple google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. here's how to build sales intelligence within your company: 1. then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. that will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. in this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments. sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs. still, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. the flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. sales intelligence is critical to your company's growth. but they're effective only if you approach them correctly. but is your company sales smart? this is where sales intelligence comes in. sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. and what's the roi? cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. that's sales 101. usually, the answer is yes. rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. sales teams face two perennial problems. evaluate potential roi. investigate key features. 3. emphasize productivity. 2.

"‘why would one of america’s top 1500m runners decide to have a baby leading into arguably the biggest year in a track athlete’s career, an olympic year?’ well, the answer is actually quite simple. though she never gave up her training — taking just a week off from exercise when she gave birth under her doctor's supervision — brown has also been savoring her moments with her newborn while on the road to rio. "my quest to continue training for the olympic trials will never compare to the continuous quest i will be on to be the best mother for you," she wrote. like any new mother, brown is learning how to adapt to her new life; she’s just figuring out sleep schedules and breastfeeding in between workouts and foam rolling. brown joins other new moms and elite runners like clara peterson and fellow olympic hopeful stephanie rothstein bruce, determined to show the world just how strong mothers are. she and her family are living in her parents’ basement apartment in warrenton, virginia, so they can have extra help with the baby while brown trains. before abigail was born, brown wrote a letter to her on her blog. in one instagram post, she used the hashtag #mommyintraining — "double meaning intended," she added. our baby girl ❤️🎀 one thing is for sure- this is one tough little lady! i didn’t," brown wrote on her blog september 15. brown documented her training during her pregnancy on her blog as well as her social media accounts.
obviously, a duck is much more likely to be in a pond, but there is definitely something strange going on here: one user commented, "jeeze that took me way too long to figure out," while another added, "i think its spine is broke." everyone is familiar with "the dress"—the poorly photographed article of clothing that divided the world and nearly broke the internet in february 2015. one user noted the similarity to a famous drawing that appears to be of both a duck and a rabbit. users are trying to figure out if it’s a duck or a rabbit. an illusion that is currently going viral on imgur, however, is really tripping up users. squint and figure it out, but please don’t break the internet. is this a duck or a rabbit? since this pandemonium, a few other optical illusion have made the rounds online, but none have bent our minds quite as much. the photo—which has been viewed more than 1.8 million times—depicts an animal floating on water.
"quarterback is the only position in the nfl where you could be mediocre and get paid," bennett told 710 espn's "brock and salk" program. bennett will get the chance to share his wide range of tannehill opinions with the man himself on sunday when the dolphins visit the seahawks in the season opener for both teams. if i was ryan tannehill and the most games i ever won was seven, how could you get a $100 million for that? which makes his adoration of former texas a&m teammate ryan tannehill, only one of the most polarizing quarterbacks in football, all the more surprising. michael bennett reveals who he thinks the best player to play for texas a&amp;m michael bennett has a reputation for outspoken views on nfl contemporaries. my brother (patriots tight end martellus bennett) would argue that, but tannehill was one of the best athletes i've even seen. "tannehill was the best athlete at our school," bennett said, according to espn.com. the same michael bennett evoked tannehill's name last summer while bemoaning the high salaries of today's passers. those opinions are known to skew negative (see: jay cutler is "the worst quarterback in the nfl."). i'm not going to like him on sunday. i guess that's the value of the position." he went to the same school as me. he was always a good guy to me." i like him as a guy. "at every other position, you can't be mediocre. he was just a smooth, cool guy. "i've always liked tannehill. he was just cool. he could do every type of dunk. better than me. i like him. that's a whole different story. "better than von (miller). he ran a 4.4.
krasinski elaborated, "i think the show was so perfect in my mind, and certainly that experience was so perfect, that i would want to continue that perfection rather than just do it just for doing it’s sake." while promoting his new flick, the hollars, john krasinski opened up about the possibility of bringing the office to the big screen. the hardest part for all of these things, certainly for the office, would be finding the story. "yeah, i mean, i’d do it," the 36-year-old actor told the insider with yahoo, "if everybody wanted to do it. is john krasinski down for bringing 'the office' to the big screen? what is the story that would bring us all together? i’m certainly open to it if someone had a great idea." we may not have seen the last of jim halpert yet!
while in orbit for his second time at the age of 77, glenn exclaimed that it is impossible not to believe in god after seeing the earth from thousands of miles above. while many will focus on the scientific miracle that allowed glenn to become the first american to orbit the earth, glenn himself noted that god was also an inseparable part of that miracle. "to look up out at this kind of creation and not believe in god is to me impossible," glenn said in 1998. in the late 1990s glenn, among other nasa astronauts lucky enough to go to space to touch the face of god, insisted that his religious faith was made stronger by his experience in space. the tweet from nasa announcing his passing hints at that something: we are saddened by the loss of sen. john glenn, the first american to orbit earth. senator from his home state, and made history once again by becoming the oldest human to go to space in 1998 at the age of 77. so, as we remember the life and works of john glenn, let us recall too his faith in a god that brought him such comfort, a god that created this awe inspiring universe full of wonder. the native ohioan made history as the first american to orbit the earth in 1962, went on to become a long-serving u.s. "to look up out at this kind of creation and not believe in god is to me impossible." the passing of john glenn, one of america’s most famous nasa astronauts, marks the end of an era for american exceptionalism. "the opportunity to join in its quests and explorations was a challenge not only to fulfill a sacred duty but to join a joyous adventure." glenn was admitted to ohio state university wexner medical center last week for treatment and passed away on thursday, december 8. big government, faith, john glenn, nasa big government, faith, john glenn, nasa big government, faith, john glenn, nasa the famed astronaut, a devout presbyterian, also noted that he was praying every day during his second historic flight in space. pic.twitter.com/89idi9r1nb — nasa (@nasa) december 8, 2016 god speed, indeed, but god was also there all along, according to glenn. defense of its ideals was an obligation," glenn wrote in 2000. but glenn said something else that may be overlooked as the nation reviews his life and times. "love of country was a given. he was 95. godspeed, john glenn. a true american hero. "it just strengthens my faith." ad astra.
all of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the summer olympics and tied for the largest medal in the summer games. the "podium value" of the gold medal at the rio 2016 olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $43.76 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of thursday. more than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the mint of brazil through a process that was developed internally. paralympic medals with new sound innovation the 2,642 paralympic award medals were made by the mint of brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the olympic medals. for the first time in history, according to rio olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm. a total of 2,488 medals were produced for the rio 2016 olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the mint of brazil. each of the 812 olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the international olympic committee) with 99.9 percent purity. if the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded. the remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the mint of brazil. this is how much a gold medal from #rio2016 is really worth: the rio 2016 summer olympic games is being billed as the "biggest sporting event on the planet." however, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 london gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time. it’s difficult to argue against that claim as more than 11,000 athletes will be competing in 28 sports and 42 disciplines for the event’s ultimate prize: the gold medal. more than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and x-ray plates. the design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal. the front of each medal has the rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient olympics). sustainable design the medals were produced with methods that the rio 2016 olympic officials described as "symbols of sustainability and accessibility ." each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the forest stewardship council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the rio 2016 logo. the rio 2016 paralympic games logo is on both sides of the medal, with braille inscriptions on the front side. this is in line with the 2014 sochi winter olympic games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (pet) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). for the first time the medals come with sound, so visually impaired athletes can identify the medal’s color . adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge. more than 100 employees in various professional fields—including, art, sustainability, engineering and production—were involved in the making of the 5,130 medals. the reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the greek panathnaic stadium in the background. the 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. olympic officials say the seeds represent "the courage, persistence and development of athletes." the gold medal makes the loudest noise and the bronze the weakest. the purity silver standard also is a minimum ioc requirement. above nike is the engraving of "xxxi olympiad" and the olympic rings. at least three winter olympic medals were larger and heavier. anthony demarco is founder of the jewelry news network. please join me on the jewelry news network facebook page, twitter @jewelrynewsnet and instagram @jewelrynewsnetwork. the podium value is about $305. the gold is mined entirely free of mercury. the bronze medals have little intrinsic value. metal ball bearings were placed inside the medals which rattle when shaken.
as if the record-breaking 133 million views isn’t enough (that’s more views than mark zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video: candace shared on candace shared on good morning america that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched candace’s hilarious stunt. but just hours after her video blew up the internet, payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we – for the first time – have begun to understand why candace’s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as chewbacca in the front seat of a car. a wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, payne seemed to be all over your facebook newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a facebook live video of her unboxing a "chewbacca" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral. and god used a beautiful daughter from texas, in a chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic star wars toy to bring joy to people’s lives. like, i don’t think my kids need that, i think i need that.’" a few minutes later, candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be "responsible" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. and i know that god has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, i feel like i wake up and i’m a jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because i have that creative buzz in me, constantly going," said candace. chewbacca mom shares real reason her video blew up the internet in the age of viral media, it’s not uncommon for a video to go crazy viral or a post to been seen by millions of eyes. we see it all the time: from the announcement of sarah palin as a running mate in 2008; thrusting her into the spotlight from obscurity, to the boy who cried "damn daniel" on vine and ended up on the ellen show and just about everywhere else. but with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn’t contain herself and decided to do an ‘unboxing’ in her car and show her friends on facebook her new find. take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the regional fine arts event: "i pray that god, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. "it doesn’t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you’re not fit to do the things that god has called you to do... and that is spiritually fit. and it’s not really going that well, but i ended up going to the toy section because i got discouraged about the yoga pants and i thought, ‘maybe not today. "for the kingdom of god is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the holy spirit." and apparently candace agrees with me as she said this morning on good morning america : "i think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. it doesn’t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren’t words to explain. "from one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven’t seen laugh, those are the stories that i’m going to take with me everyday," said candace. just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an arts conference in texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from heaven. so with a smile that’s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the "chewie" mask out of the box and put it on. candace payne’s video went viral not just because she’s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). the thing that will take you further and farther in the kingdom of god is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... do not try to make a name for yourself. candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn’t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. in fact, never before in history has someone had the ability to be plucked from obscurity and rise to a national — or international — platform as quickly as in this 21st century digital age. and many times that comes in the form of laughter — deep, beautiful laughter — that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others. you have no idea how inspiring you really are... or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the spirit come out of you so freely. but i can get a toy for my kids.’ and i walk through the toy section and i accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine. thank you so much candace payne for sharing the joy of the lord that is inside of you with the world. if you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking god to give you his joy and then belly-laugh along with candace. her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is filled with the love and joy of jesus. literally, candace payne’s video has set new records as being the most-viewed facebook live video with over 133 million views. "when i was 16, i had a vision and a dream from the lord about my future being used for his glory. i think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism — worldwide." not only is payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she’s someone who loves jesus too. she walked into kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but little did candace know that god had other plans for her. then go and spread your joy with others and you’ll find that your joy will be always flowing. "your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the lord’s people."

"i was there for myself for some yoga pants because i’m trying to work out more. but that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that i walk and follow jesus. candace is active in her church, the oaks fellowship in red oak, texas (just outside of dallas) and she’s a dedicated wife and momma. i was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time i watched candace’s hilarious video. and as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. and i had seen this before, but i didn’t realize it made sounds until that moment. it accidentally started making the growl, and i went, ‘i need to get that. i’ve seen plenty of viral videos before — in fact, it’s a part of my job. to the point that she couldn’t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes. -isaiah 35:10 "those who have been ransomed by the lord will return. it’s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame. the newest member of the "gone viral" club is none other than texas native candace payne. often, a hallmark of the holy spirit’s work in your life is joy. the world is hungry — no, they’re starving — for the joy of the lord. in fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if candace’s influence extends long past 15 minutes. i still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. -candace payne and that’s not all of the mic drop moments candace spoke. then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the holy spirit." "those who have been ransomed by the lord will return. sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness." but here’s where her words get really good. the bible says that his joy is our strength. i didn’t understand the interpretation of it. but something is different about candace payne. -romans 14:17 candace is no ordinary "15-minute-famer." we’re talking – "it broke the internet." and boy does it show. his name will always outshadow yours." they will enter jerusalem singing, crowned with everlasting joy. -isaiah 35:10 -philemon 1:7 don’t believe me? then laughter ensued.
these realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said sophia chou, an organizational psychology researcher at national taiwan university, who presented her findings at a meeting of the american psychological association in honolulu, hawaii earlier this month. [7 things that will make you happy] optimists and pessimists past research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. but a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, chou said. in order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said. after several years working in business, chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, chou said. the surveys tested how many "positive illusions" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality. "every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'i have no choice and this is the only thing i can do.' so-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found. people with this personality type may be happier and more successful are you a "glass half-full" or a "glass half-empty" kind of person? traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. that's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, chou said. "realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement," chou said. being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: they are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. the findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, chou said. self-control key she found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships. that allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present. so chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in taiwan. they will be creative, they will have a plan a, plan b and plan c," chou said. realistic views the optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists. as it turns out, some people can be both. to understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments. she wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed. optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall.

"the homosexual, gay issue in today’s society is so hypersensitive, you can’t talk about anything without them jumping on you and being totally negative," elmer said. it was a question as to whether or not that advocacy needed to happen in that environment." elmer had been at a book fair at his third-grade child’s school when he saw several teens wearing the shirts. promo, a statewide lgbt advocacy organization, wrote a news release in support of the school’s gsa students. however, he said he is not opposed to students belonging to gay-straight alliances, called gsas for short. http://t.co/ilgyokflrn — aaron malin (@malinaaron) october 18, 2013 @kevinelmer you see a tshirt that says "gay". here, @kevinelmer explains yesterday’s tweet by basically saying young kids shouldn’t know lgbt people exist. still, students at the school and gay rights advocates are firing back at the state representative. the photo showed only the girl’s torso, according to the springfield news-leader. on twitter, responses to elmer’s tweet were swift and negative. i see a tshirt that says harmony and love. hs students working elementary school book fair in gay [t]-shirts." rep. kevin elmer (r-nixa) reportedly tweeted thursday: "nixa schools failure.

in the run-up to the release of harry potter and the cursed child, were gathering all the info we can get about what has happened in the 19 years since the battle of hogwarts. that position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at hogwarts, since voldemorts death broke the jinx that kept a defense against the dark arts professor from remaining for more than a year. nineteen years after the battle of hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (mcgonagall was really getting on a bit) as well as a new defense against the dark arts teacher. after serving as an auror for a number of years, neville longbottom eventually moved on to serve as the herbology professor at hogwarts. she advanced the rights of magical creatures and eradicated the old pro-pure-blood laws in the department of magical law enforcement, of which she is the head. the remaining death eaters were killed or imprisoned in azkaban for their crimes, with the exception of the malfoys. harry will not train to be an animagus his energies are going to be concentrated elsewhere and hes not going to have time to do that. after his death, voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that harry sees in the kings cross-like limbo. harrys was to make sure that the wizarding world knew that snape was a hero and on dumbledores side. members of the da still have their coins, as they are like badges of honor. hermione tells scrimgeour that she is not planning to embark on a career in magical law. after the war was over, hermiones first act was to find her parents in australia and restore their memories. hermione granger was the only member of the trio who returned to hogwarts to complete their seventh year. 33 things that have happened in the harry potter universe since the series ended. the number of dementors has been greatly diminished because despair and degradation have been lessened in the world. harry would take his family to visit dudleys when they were in the neighbourhood (occasions dreaded by james, albus and lily). j.k.rowling let slip these hints about what has happened to our favorite characters, and the wizarding world in general. in the aftermath of the war, the order was disbanded once and for all. draco and harry never became friends, but they did come to understand and appreciate each other better. harry will never become headmaster of hogwarts since an academic career just isnt him. the head of the auror office as of 2007 is harry potter. the quibbler is back to publishing articles about the lunatic fringe and is appreciated for its unintentional humour. the resurrection stone is now buried in the forbidden forest after being pressed into the ground by a centaurs hoof. ron worked with george in weasleys wizard wheezes prior to officially becoming an auror. harry, ron and neville went straight to get training as aurors. hagrid was still working at hogwarts by 2017, at 88 years old. the death eaters dark marks eventually faded to look like a scar. neville longbottoms students were impressed when he showed them his dumbledores armys coin. kingsley shacklebolt became the minister of magic after the second wizarding war. viktor krum fell in love with a woman back home in bulgaria and presumably lived happily ever after. what happened to her later on was never revealed. lavender brown was attacked by fenrir greyback during the battle of hogwarts. harry lost the ability to speak parseltongue when voldemorts soul fragment was destroyed. dolores umbridge was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned for crimes against muggleborns. hermione saved her but she was already injured. he never married, although he had a relationship with a giantess. azkaban no longer uses dementors as guardians. it will no longer burn or hurt. it has not been re-discovered. ironically, thats where she ends up. 19/33. 3/33. 6/33. 2/33. 4/33. 1/33. 5/33. 23/33. 14/33. 22/33. 15/33. 8/33. 21/33. 9/33. 20/33. 10/33. 11/33. 18/33. 17/33. 12/33. 16/33. 13/33. 7/33.

though you may have come across that "as seen on tv" infomercial for spray perfect, the company that's actually credited with revolutionizing the product is london-based company nails inc. their paint can sprays are now available stateside in three highly pigmented shades, including hoxton market (a hot pink), mayfair lane (a pastel pink) and shoreditch lane (a gleaming silver). don't worry about getting the spray-on nail polish all over your fingers -- you can remove the excess paint by simply washing your hands or using a makeup remover wipe. here's exactly how it works, demonstrated in gifs by nails inc. you start by applying a base coat -- because you've got to protect your natural nails and provide a smooth surface for the pigment to adhere to. this trend is perfect for people who can't paint their own nails some may call the spray-on nail polish trend "lazy" or "messy," but we think it's pretty awesome. unlike traditional nail lacquers that require a steady hand and a long drying time, aerosol-based nail polishes allow you to spray on a manicure in under 20 seconds. you can either use your own traditional brush-on base coat, or one that may be sold with your spray-on polish. milk makeup and china glaze have recently added spray-on nail polishes to their beauty lines, proving that this trend isn't going anywhere any time soon. and be sure to hold the bottle at least 3 to 5 inches above your hand to evenly disperse the pigment. pro tip: place a paper towel or old newspaper to prevent getting product all over the place. next, shake up the can and spray on your nail polish. seal your manicure with a traditional top coat and you're done! amazing, right?
for example, ‘it looks terrible!’ or ‘no you’re the worst!’ followed by ‘only joking, of course you’re wonderful!’ macmillan cancer support’s new murder mystery fundraising game ‘whodunnit?’ takes place on saturday 25th march. tell the truth first: in an emergency such as: ‘do you like my new hair cut?’ or ‘am i the best lover you’ve ever had?’ it can help if you expel the truth first. the poker face: although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they’re being economical with the truth. body language expert reveals nine ways to spot a liar there's nothing worse than having the wool pulled over your eyes, and when it happens you often wonder how someone managed to deceive you. for more information visit www.whodunnit.org.uk  macmillan cancer support’s new murder mystery fundraising game ‘whodunnit?’ takes place on saturday 25th march. when the gestures and the words are at odds it’s called incongruent gesticulation and it’s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth. experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie. now body language expert judi james has revealed the key signs to look out for if you're concerned someone is being economical with the truth. heckling hands: the hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie. self-comfort touches: the stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. 'despite the fact there are no "one-size-fits-all" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone’s not being totally honest with you.' the mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard. also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away. actors call this a ‘bit of business’ which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language. first your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie. when we look up to our left to think we’re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. the eye dart: humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we’re trying to hide something. while she warns that there is 'no set formula' for spotting a liar, recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber. 'while i don’t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said. this often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like ‘why do you ask that?’ rather than a direct and open response. overcompensating: a liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. the best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. 'forget all those claims of "tells" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth. convince yourself first: the brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language. keep busy: if you’re not very good at lying, try to keep busy when you perform the lie. relax: to combat the fight/flight response, breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles, especially the ones in your shoulders, arms and hands. micro-gestures: these are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. it might look rude but it can be better than over-sharing in terms of your body language giveaways! the lost breath: bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated. visualisation is the nearest you’ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent. the face hide: when someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. judi james is supporting macmillan cancer support’s new murder mystery fundraising game whodunnit? we all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing. this can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover. gather your friends for an evening of bluffing, accusations and outrageous over-acting to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer. the mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away. these over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) the big pause: lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. slow your own down a little, as this will help create reassurance in your audience. and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part. don’t just think of the transcript, visualise the whole story including all the smallest details. 'a bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting,' she explained. slow your blink rate: fibbing often causes a give-away accelerated blink rate. 'but a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool, calm and confident. for more information visit www.whodunnit.org.uk keep your vocal tone a little lower - lying can make us more shrill. and over-emphatic gesticulation. sip a cup of tea etc.

the research firm symantec has been looking into the bangladesh bank heist, and on thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal bangladesh’s millions was also used to hack a bank in the philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in vietnam last year. that group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the u.s. and south korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an ecuadoran bank last year. security investigators linked thefts from banks in asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of bangladesh in february, to a hacking group in north korea. since investigators learned how hackers stole bangladesh’s money, banks that had kept similar heists quiet have come forward: just last week, it was revealed in a lawsuit that the banco del austro in ecuador was targeted, as well. pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put north korea’s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with south korea’s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion. the fbi has linked this group to the sony hacks, and those hacks to north korea. the code, symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of sony pictures’s emails. investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as lazarus. an expert quoted by the times said: "if you presume it’s north korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their g.d.p. the system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in brussels, and prides itself on security. the way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, swift. the new york times adds: north korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. is north korea behind bank heists? this is not small change for them."
but look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans' charitable causes. 'worst' charity for veterans run by va employee story highlights the national vietnam veterans foundation raised nearly $9 million in 2014 but it donated less than 2% of that money washington (cnn) at first glance, the national vietnam veterans foundation is a roaring success. that's why charity navigator, one of the nation's largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a "zero" out of four stars for those same four years. the charity's most recently filed tax return, for 2014, lists a catalogue of expenses paid for by donations: including $133,000 for travel, $21,000 for unnamed "awards", $70,000 for a category described as "other expenses" and even a little more than $8,000 for parking. according to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website "aiding, supporting and benefiting america's veterans and their families." "they don't have an independent board of directors, they actually don't even have a comprehensive board of directors -- only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family.

dmx arrested again nov 5 - rapper dmx, whose real name is earl simmons, was arrested outside a south carolina airport on monday for driving with a suspended license and without a vehicle tag and insurance, according to the spartanburg county detention center. he was arrested in south carolina in august and charged with possession of marijuana two days before he was due in court on a drunk driving charge. airport police familiar with simmons and his lengthy arrest history stopped him as he was driving to the greenville-spartanburg international airport early on monday evening, a police dispatcher said. the 42-year-old entertainer spent several hours in jail before posting a $1,335 bond on the charges, according to spartanburg county detention center. the new york-born rapper, who lives in south carolina, was arrested when he did not have a valid license, the dispatcher said. "he was arrested on minor traffic charges and spent only three hours in jail," said domenick nati, a spokesman for the rapper. he was arrested in july on suspicion of driving under the influence and failing to have a valid driver's license. the rapper, whose albums include "it's dark and hell is hot" and "flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood," also starred in the movies "romeo must die" and "cradle 2 the grave." simmons' arrest record also includes charges of animal cruelty, reckless driving, drug possession and probation violations. simmons has had numerous run-ins with police in south carolina and elsewhere. he has had several felony convictions and has served prison time in arizona. nati said simmons still planned to perform on wednesday. "this short arrest will not affect any of his upcoming concerts." he was booked at 6:27 p.m. local time.
her bff kamya punjabi is all set to release her short film 'hum kuchh kah na sakey' that she shot right before her untimely death but looks like pratyusha's former boyfriend rahul raj has a problem with that. #pratyusha's former boyfriend #rahulraj thinks this is a publicity stunt anandi of television, pratyusha banerjee who committed suicide, last year in april, is back in news again. rahul feels kamya and the makers of the film are trying to seek publicity. we really hope the movie turns out to be a tribute to pratyusha and not a mere publicity stunt. speaking to a leading daily, rahul said, "if you see the promo, it shows a chubbier pratyusha. instead of garnering publicity in her name, let her rest in peace." he also said that pratyusha never shot for the film. this was how she looked two years ago when she had gained weight.
a recent study by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and vanderbilt university medical center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season. they include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic. as an added bonus, a new study published in the journal of the american medical association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. what's new this year, says dr. michael jhung, medical officer at the cdc, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. (follow us @reutersmoney or at http://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance; editing by lauren young and meredith mazzilli) his wife, however, soon sent him back in. it's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the cdc, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown. many large firms like walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small. "i told him, 'if you get sick from the flu and can't work, you'll feel foolish over $70,'" says anne delgado, 66, who is retired. (follow us @reutersmoney or at http://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance; editing by lauren young and meredith mazzilli) "i also worried if everyone at work knew i got a flu shot, it'll be harder to take sick days if i do get the flu," says walsh, 38. recent studies from the european union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to kris ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the minnesota department of health. last winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. why it's definitely worth it to get your flu shot oct 28 - when her law office offered flu shots in mid-october, kelly walsh, a paralegal in boston, hesitated. only 42 percent of americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the cdc. based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people. the cdc estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations. the cdc estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year. the elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu. the high-dose version of the shot, recommended for older people, often costs more than the normal vaccine. the year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot. typically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. peter delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a cambridge, massachusetts, rite aid before getting his flu shot. "there was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70," says delgado, who lives nearby. walsh didn't get vaccinated last year and didn't get sick. part of those costs are then passed along to employers in the form of higher premiums and lost productivity. but walk into your local cvs or walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the food and drug administration. everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. "but now is the time to get vaccinated," she adds. "one shot could mean food on the table for us." "we don't prefer one vaccine over another," jhung says. employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. one reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, jhung notes. most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. his wife, however, soon sent him back in. ultimately, however, walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies. flu activity usually peaks in the united states in january or february. several vaccination options are available. flu shots aren't always free. "whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy."

to figure out why some choose to work overtime even when they know it's not good for health, the researchers turned to a mathematical analysis called becker's theory of the allocation of time, which helps to measure the cost of time. bad news for workaholics if you're addicted to checking your email and regularly work through evenings, weekends and vacations, you might be a workaholic -- and your health may be suffering because of it. "we found workaholics -- defined by those working more than 50 hours per week -- were more likely to have reduced physical well-being, measured by skipped meals," doctoral researcher, sarah asebedo, said in a statement. a number of studies have shown the detrimental toll that work stress in particular can take on your health, including depression and an increased risk of heart attack and diabetes. but turning on that out-of-office autoreply and taking some time to rest and recharge can actually have a positive effect on not just your well-being, but also your productivity. even if you understand the negative consequences to workaholism, you may still be likely to continue working because the cost of not doing so becomes greater." "[becker's theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good," asebedo said in the statement. more than eight in 10 americans are stressed about their jobs -- citing an unreasonable workload as their number-one stressor -- and 61 percent of employed vacationers will work through their vacation this year (up from 52 percent last year). "also, we found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score." the kansas state university study, which will be published in the journal financial planning review, found that well-being is generally not a priority for workaholics. and with the possibility to work from anywhere, at anytime, it's easier than ever to become a workaholic in the first place. if you are not engaged in work-related activities, then there is a cost to the alternative way in which time is spent. "this theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more. "renewal is a way in which to increase your capacity to be more effective." the theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income. of course, it's no secret that overworking can have a negative effect on your health and happiness. and workaholism in particular has been associated with poor sleep quality, weight gain, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, not to mention unhappy marriages and higher divorce rates. it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively. recent research has found a link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being. the findings are based on data from the 1979 cohort of the national longitudinal survey of youth that included 12,686 young men and women. all the study participants were interviewed each year until 1994, and are still interviewed biennially. "renewal is not for slackers," tony schwartz, ceo of the energy project, told the huffington post. even a short nap can boost cognitive functioning, improving creative thinking, learning and memory.
overwatch has a secret character and she’s going to be revealed soon overwatch has a secret character and she’s going to be revealed soon a new character might be on its way for joining the overwatch roster soon. apart from these, there has also been information that sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to overwatch soon. a story about this was covered in detail by neogaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named sombra can come to overwatch soon. at this point we can certainly say that there’s something or someone called sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to overwatch, but it’ll be interesting to find out what blizzard thinks on this. pointing at the second clue nirolak wrote, "way back in november, people noticed that there’s a table in dorado with files for soldier 76/jack morrison and sombra. overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from blizzard. there are also speculations that sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. given soldier 76 is jack morrison, this only leaves the mysterious sombra file, which would fit with a soldier 76 vs. sombra animated short." the grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with soldier 76 and reaper. to start with, they pointed out to a french theater ad which suggested that sombra will be unveiled for overwatch soon. however neogaf user, nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes. nirolak also mentioned about reaper’s dialogue in the game where he says, "where is sombra when you need her? cyber detectives and some overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by blizzard on their videos. soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. she wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. they are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together. we’ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this. ", which can be another massive hint. keep a track of this feed. sombra has also made several appearances in various stages.

then, when it comes to editing, i got to the point when i wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: what was clear to them and what was not clear to them. if you speak with vin, i'm thinking he would say, "never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. after that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million. because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and i still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. that means even vin diesel -- who, thanks to the "fast and furious" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third "riddick" movie. hollywood didn't want to make this vin diesel movie filmmaking in 2013: "riddick," the third vin diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature. then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him. maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, "maybe we need a cameo from vin" -- because he wasn't in that movie. i enjoyed that in "riddick" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. and enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. and i said, "this doesn't feel right to me" but vin, he was saying, "that was then, this is now" ... so with the "fast and furious" franchise and his relationship with universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at universal. after a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for riddick. it's something twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie. so, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the u.s. and canada. we went up to montreal and i think i did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. you are totally sympathetic with riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man." because "pitch black" did well, that allowed him to be part of the "fast and furious" franchise. so, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in "the fast and the furious." so, riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as "riddick" director david twohy calls him, "the bogey man." the film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the north american box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. so, that's how he got the rights back and i think that was a great business move. i didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, i just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... i think this was about the time that "fast 3" had already shot and they were testing it. let's start with "the chronicles of riddick," the sequel to "pitch black," which was released on june 11, 2004. do you think the success of the "fast and furious" movies helped to get "riddick" made? so, i do believe that in his savviness, vin said, "don't pay me for that cameo. vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, "well, give me the rights back." according to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. i thought it was going to be sony or film district -- they were both eager to have the movie. and based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. so, his company basically controls the rights and because i control all of the sequels and remakes. and i can bolster riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him. that's what i set out to do and vin was certainly along for that ride, too. did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after "the chronicles of riddick" underperformed? you spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. even though universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. i had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. these people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it. and i guess it's because he is a very smart guy. after "chronicles," they said, "we are out of the riddick business. so, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. in this new installment, we find riddick (diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. here's an example of how it's an indie film. now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. they put money into it for their domestic distribution rights. so, i hope that "riddick," if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. so universal didn't put any money into the film? and they didn't want to do that ... look, i've learned never to count vin diesel out. i wrote a spec script, we sold that. and look, i've been in those meetings, too. so, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. where it's, "we have to up the stakes. yeah, i had my doubts after the second one. because i have to introduce those new characters ... it's just a straight business calculation of us. but, here's the cyclical nature of the business. vin diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years. so, no, we're not going to do anymore." the first half hour, we're pretty much alone with riddick. we have to give it a ticking clock" ... we came back into town looking for a domestic partner. i'm more the pragmatist of the duo. in fact, they didn't make it. why did you want to do that? but, you know i think it works. i have like 10 new characters to establish. maybe, though, that was for the best. universal raises their hand, "well, what about us?" because he is both those things. just give me the rights back." so riddick is an indie film? he is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. so, that's never a good formula. smarter than people give him credit for. just don't do that. i wrote a spec script. we sold it in berlin for international. how did he get here? so, i had my doubts. you can contact him directly on twitter. he is a big dreamer. he is a man. what goes around, comes around. do you know that story? it goes like this. and then, guess what? so, very pure filmmaking. and we suffered some slings and arrows. that's right. and guess what? i do not. "wait a second. mike ryan is senior writer for huffington post entertainment. very pure. yes.
mashable reports that nasa tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of. [nasa reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’] but that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s cupola, a european-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken. because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. these days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there. the danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film "gravity," in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk. according to the european space agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across. and you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it. "i am often asked if the international space station is hit by space debris," british astronaut tim peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. that’s just one piece of a much bigger problem the hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for earthbound folk. especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of earth. and the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across. "yes — this is the chip in one of our cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!" (esa/nasa) when you sit around imagining life aboard the international space station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. (youtube/nasa) the astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. in 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting earth. a bit of debris chipped the international space station. debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. nasa released an animation depicting space trash in motion around earth. a flake of paint. space junk is definitely a real concern. you can say that again. let that sink in. um, yeah.
lowest total qbr since 2010 tim tebow 33.4 geno smith 35.7 chad henne 36.9 mark sanchez 40.4 sam bradford 40.7 * minimum 30 games as qb sanchez was off-target (over or underthrown) on a higher percentage of passes than any other qualified quarterback in the nfl over the last five seasons (22 percent), but that's only because tim tebow (30 percent overthrow rate) didn't rank in the top 30 in the nfl in pass attempts over that span. the only eagles quarterback currently on the roster with any experience keeping on a zone read is mark sanchez, who did so six times for 38 yards last season. the eagles have utilized the zone-read option a league-high 514 times the last two seasons, 235 times more than the next closest team (seahawks). the three each rank in the bottom five in total qbr among those who started at least 30 games over the last five seasons. that’s more recent than any quarterback on the eagles roster and three years after the eagles’ most recent playoff win. the one notable thing that tebow has going for him is that his last playoff win came in 2011. during his career, tebow rushed the ball four times with his team at the one or two yard line. tim tebow may not be the best quarterback on the eagles' roster, but he has something that might help him succeed. tebow’s completion percentage (48 percent) ranks the lowest in the nfl over the last 10 seasons. among the suggested proposals, the league could eliminate extra points altogether (forcing teams to go for a two-point conversion). something else worth keeping in mind: the nfl is still considering adjusting the extra point conversion at this may's owners meetings. in his nfl career, tim tebow has kept on 41 zone-read options for 256 yards. if signed, tebow would join mark sanchez and sam bradford among the team’s signal-callers. the philadelphia eagles added another to their collection of statistically-struggling quarterbacks with the addition of tim tebow on sunday. sanchez, bradford and matt barkley have combined to rush for 671 yards in their careers. sanchez is fourth-worst (40.4) and bradford ranks fifth from the bottom (40.7). all three quarterbacks tend to overthrow or underthrow their passes quite a bit. tebow ranks lowest with a 33.4 total qbr. overall, tebow has rushed for 989 yards in his career. so why did the eagles sign him? tebow could become a zone-read specialist. he scored on all four carries.

i just want to take some of the pressure off when i want to go out for a ride, and if i have to cough up some money to do that, so be it. about a mile later, i’m stopped at a red light, and the guy comes up to me and starts interrogating me about why i didn’t return his wave. when asked about the inconvenience of having to trade in his motorcycle for a bike of another marque and the resulting monetary loss, brandt was able to put things into perspective in terms of a simple cost-benefit analysis. "if a guy on a suzuki doesn’t wave, you have to wonder if he didn’t see you, or if he was using the clutch. maybe he was having a bad day, but you don’t want to assume that, because you really don’t even know the other rider. i didn’t even put two and two together that they were waving at me just because i was on a motorcycle," brandt explained. — a 34-year-old lincoln man purchased a 2012 harley-davidson softail slim motorcycle this past tuesday in an effort to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists. he rode in on a 2012 honda shadow, which he traded in to frontier harley-davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle. but when you see a harley, you know why the guy on it doesn’t wave. in fact, guys on the harley machines don’t even wave to riders on other harleys!" i can’t have people i don’t know coming up to me and yelling at me unannounced." i mean, i didn’t even want to get rid of it, but let’s get right down to the nitty-gritty. "when you ride a harley, you just don’t have to wave," brandt said. sometimes i would see people i didn’t know, and they would wave to me. russell "rusty" brandt entered frontier harley-davidson’s front door around 11 a.m. with more than a thousand dollars in his wallet. a few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle. safety was a big consideration in his decision to purchase the big harley machine. you don’t have to wave if you’re on a harley. "last week, i didn’t wave to a guy i passed on the left. i was in the middle of shifting gears, and didn’t think about it. i moved here to lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot. "i learned to ride when i lived in creighton, and there weren’t many people there. brandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase. brandt mentioned some safety aspects that he says other riders don’t consider. it’s because he’s on a harley. "it’s really not that big of a deal. "the shadow was a really good bike. i told her i was trading the bike. i wanted a new bike anyway." still, brandt remained positive about his future in motorcycling. "it probably happened half a dozen times in two years. man purchases harley-davidson motercycle. they expect you to wave back. he was really losing it. i went right home and told my wife. it’s almost like a religion." it will be worth it." i have a family. really good. lincoln, neb. source: revzilla source: revzilla his reason is unbelievable!...

"we did see a noticeable slowdown post-easter," smith said on a media conference call. [note: this post was authored by the analytical economist] [note: this post was authored by the analytical economist] shares of the company, which also reported slower digital sales growth, fell more than 9 percent to $66.74 in early trading. big swings in temperature? so they’re going to blame climate change?

"people say, ‘man, you're going to be such a blessing to those girls,'" mullin said at a town hall meeting last week. "we were unsure about whether, at this time, we could handle the extra responsibility," he told the oklahoman. "if you talk to anybody, they say twins need to be together. but that all changed when he met the girls last christmas and witnessed their incredible bond. according to the hill, the adoption was officially approved last wednesday.

‘our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that bernie is by far the strongest candidate against donald trump’ sanders has a long road ahead of him if he hopes to convince the party’s super delegates to back him over clinton, as many of them have been strong supporters of her campaign since she first announced her candidacy. a spokesman for the sanders campaign, briggs, has said that the senator is planning on heading back to vermont on wednesday, but will be back on the campaign trail by thursday when he will head to washington, dc. the reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of clinton’s victories in new jersey and california, though some of them might be offered jobs in sanders’ senate office. a lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well. clinton, who has been declared the party’s nominee by many in the media, such as the ap, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. bernie sanders makes major announcement to his entire staff and followers (quotes) sources close to the sanders campaign have reported that the vermont senator will begin laying off a large part of his staff starting wednesday. despite the layoffs, sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. the reports of the layoff came after clinton’s victory on tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in california and new jersey. it is important to note that despite clinton’s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. a spokesman for the campaign, micheal briggs, reiterated this plan during a statement at a sanders rally that was held on monday in san francisco. whether or not sanders can persuade the party’s leadership to back him remains to be seen, but it is a long shot. the super delegates will not vote until the democratic national convention, which will be held the last week of july. it is an argument that sanders has made throughout this primary season and it’s one that the poll numbers back up. sanders is planning on holding several rallies in washington dc, which holds the last primary on june 14th. sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face donald trump in november. the clintons have enjoyed strong support among the democratic party since bill clinton’s election in 1992. the majority of polls have sanders defeating trump by a larger margin than clinton does. there are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination. she currently has 2,184 compared to sanders 1,804. super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate.

guess which famous andy warhol painting could fetch $60 million this fall it may just look like a simple, retro coca cola advertisement -- and hey, it basically is -- but the familiar black-and-white pop piece is actually an iconic painting by the one and only andy warhol. "you can be watching tv and see coca cola, and you know that the president drinks coca cola, liz taylor drinks coca cola, and just think, you can drink coca cola, too." but if you happen to catch sight of warhol's "coca-cola (3)" -- which will be on view in london from october 12-18, don't be fooled. "what’s great about this country is that america started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest," andy warhol once quipped. created in 1962, the massive, human-sized canvas is heading to auction in new york city this fall, as part of christie's post-war and contemporary art sale. and before you start thinking, "hey, that poster would look fantastic in my bedroom," you might want to check the price tag. the work had been housed in a previous collection for the past two decades, making cameo appearances at almost every warhol retrospective in recent memory, christie's explained in a press statement. in other news, eric clapton might make $25 million off the sale of a gerhard richter painting. given that mr. warhol was the world's biggest seller in 2012, we have high, high hopes. warhol is probably high fiving a million angels as he contemplates the irony of his own fate. we're pretty sure only the wealthiest of consumers can afford this one. that is, if you have $40 to $60 million sitting around. but the stark soda masterpiece is officially up for grabs on november 12, 2013. it could set you back up to $60 million. stay tuned to see how much the painting reels in. yes, you read that right.
studies have found that where we perceive bacteria thriving in bathrooms can be completely backwards, and what we use to keep us clean could actually be spreading the problem around! we have no idea who has been in there before us, and sometimes, we just can’t help but feel wary of public toilets, considering all of the crazy things that have been found in them. if the toilet doesn’t have a lid, remember that bacteria thrives in warm, wet places, so keep any surface dry, including your hands, your body, and any of the bathroom appliances. the powerful buffeting of dryers propels germs around the room and onto your hands, which can grow and increase, especially if you don’t dry them completely! when these feelings of insecurity strike, we usually reach for the nearest available seat cover and — if one isn’t available — we then make one of our own out of toilet paper. despite this, many people opt to line the seat with toilet paper — but really, this seemingly clean practice may actually be increasing your exposure to germs. as long as you remain aware of where bacteria is actually present, you can make smart decisions toward remaining healthy, happy, and free of more germs than are necessary! in fact, a study from the the journal of applied microbiology found that hand dryers were among the largest distributors of bacteria, other than flushing toilets. with every flush, germs are sprayed up and out of the toilet — and often exposed right onto the toilet paper. according to today.com, germs are not easily spreadable on toilet seats, since many different bacteria and viruses don’t survive long outside of a human body. read below to learn how bacteria is spread in all bathrooms, and what steps we should be taking to keep scary bathroom germs at bay! washing your hands is extremely important after you use the restroom, but drying them thoroughly and disposing of your paper towels is just as important. our skin does a great job of blocking bacteria, so trust in its ability to do its job when sitting on a dry toilet seat. but toilet seats are actually designed to keep as much bacteria off of you as possible. but toilet paper isn’t the only place where germs dwell more happily than toilet seats. though they are definitely more environmentally friendly, these dryers actually spread more germs than ordinary paper towels. there is a general misconception that covering toilet seats keeps you safe from germs. so what’s the best way to ensure you’re not spreading or picking up germs? but in truth, creating this protective paper barrier could be doing you way more harm than good. their special shape and material were specifically designed to prevent bacteria from dwelling on their surface for very long. sometimes, public bathrooms are a necessary evil, especially during long car rides or when nature calls inconveniently. toilet paper, unlike toilet seats, are not designed to ward off bacteria. you should never line the toilet seat with paper. though most are pretty pristine, every once in a while, we run into some truly unsavory public bathroom situations. closing the toilet seat lid before flushing! this lifehack may seem like a perfectly harmless, even safe, practice. in fact, they’re sponges for it. the reason? shocking!
primarily seen as fascinating educational opportunities, safe spaces dedicated to the preservation of endangered species, and parks filled with a variety of wildlife so that the public at large can see and learn about various animals, zoos are designed to foster the welfare of many animals, albeit in captivity. a suicidal man made a decision that would end in tragedy at the santiago zoo in the chilean capital city on may 21, but his death wish did not turn out as intended. every once in a while, a new story pops up that reminds us that even in their manmade homes, animals in zoos are still second-class citizens when it comes to the dangerous and unpredictable actions of humans. man uses lions at zoo to commit suicide, but all goes horribly wrong a death wish gone wrong the concept of a zoo is twofold. on the other hand, many people view zoos as veritable prisons, cruel jails that keep animals in questionable conditions behind bars and never allow them to live in their natural habitats in the wild. he tried to use the lions as vehicles for a quick suicide, but they ended up becoming the victims.
it wasn't rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious. — alex micu (@axelk) september 27, 2016 snapchat spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because a) the camera is at your eye level b) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com/qosgvh3j9e — gary he (@garyhe) september 24, 2016 but you know what they say—there's truth in every joke. "i've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when i was still getting intimate with a partner," rachel, the media entrepreneur, said. there's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: spectacles as a sex toy. while rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her story. "we haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there’s a new gadget, we’re very excited in terms of how to explore it," he said. "i hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn," one early spectacles owner explained. to wit, take our friend richard's feedback: "the circular video part"—which is how spectacles films footage, where users watching spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone—"was really cool." "it was the first thing i thought as we were waiting in line," said media entrepreneur rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in venice beach with the guy she's seeing. cindy gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called makelovenotporn, said she wished snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case. his company embraced the first wearable camera, google glass, and used it to create an app called "tits and glass" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013. will they see these as a different kind of pov niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership," said lynn comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at university of nevada, las vegas. and sure, snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused live stories and publisher perspectives on discover (which is a mashable partner). (hint: sex) when snap ceo evan spiegel described spectacles—his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses—in a september wall street journal story, he called them a "toy." i was there, and this is what i'm seeing, and i remember what i was feeling when i re-watch the videos." a series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iphone, which jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend. still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the stories off of the app, deletes them from snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder. richard and jennifer saved their videos in "my eyes only," a section of the app protected by a pin code, which snapchat released back in july. jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of spectacles make for strange bedfellows—literally. she credited snapchat's "explosive growth"—which now boasts 150 million daily active users—to sexting, and though mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app. mashable reached out to more than two dozen spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy. as for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using spectacles, but one could still—and isn't unlikely to—show up in the near future. you have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com/klm9kzm7b2 — damon beres ✨ (@dlberes) september 24, 2016 how will sex tapes change after spectacles? of the 26 spectacles owners we spoke with, mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex. jesse adams, co-founder and ceo of adult content app platform mikandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of spectacles. snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. i didn’t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on," she said. rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. its foundation in disappearing messages—the once-unique feature that made snapchat a must-have—made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. given the limited availability of snapchat spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. "my friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex," another said. "with the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit." the idea was practically floated by snap themselves in the marketing for spectacles—photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless. snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the snapchat support and safety pages for reference. a pornography section of its community guidelines states, "snapchat prohibits accounts that use public stories to distribute sexually explicit content." and people have definitely been executing on the potential for spectacles as a sex toy. all sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for snap and snapchat. but by releasing a physical product like spectacles, snap inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. he saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of spectacles from the shop in new york. right after the initial spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. the idea was an obvious one for some snapchat users, rachel and richard included. just as snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for spectacles. i remember thinking at the time: i wish there was a strap," richard said. "the question is what appeal will these spectacles have, if any, to this industry. there's no control or limitation to what users do with snapchat privately, of course. and with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun. "it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit," she said. "spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context," gallop said. "i liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times. "i'm a little skeptical about how much snapchat can see," she said. (names of users have been changed by mashable at their request for privacy.) see also: people are already hacking their snapchat spectacles rachel's not alone. that's not too surprising given that spectacles only upload videos directly to snapchat. of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. financial analyst richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. i think teal"—the color of her spectacles—"was a bad choice," she said. "we thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. the app saves all spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your snapchat memories. spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using spectacles during sex. "i would love to see snap be open and active about it. yet—most of them have at least had the idea. "by turning my phone," he continued, "i get a whole new vantage point." "it seemed easy, and better than a phone," he told mashable. here’s the secret way people are using snapchat spectacles. "the specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than google glass." "i deleted the videos right after, and we tried again." and this one's time is coming. "will it be different from google glass?" "there was a barrier, in terms of personal space. of his own amateur sex footage, he means. to say nothing of the viewing, itself. the gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however. of course, behind closed doors, it's already happened. in fact, spectacles owners have some recommendations. and maybe, one day, someone else's. "the glasses kept slipping off. the experience wasn't seamless. they don't. so far, reviews are mixed.

assume higher nonwhite support for the democrat—let’s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among hispanics, giving clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively—and trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn’t change. if trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and latino turnout of 2008. there’s still a strong case to make that donald trump is a long shot for the white house—that he’s too unpopular with too many americans outside the republican party and that if the obama coalition holds, he loses. given two unpopular candidates, it’s possible that "popularity" just won’t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates’ worst qualities as a given and move on. ok, ok. "possible" doesn’t mean "likely," and it’s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding team romney’s ability to pinpoint and bring republican-leaning white voters to the polls. it’s why the "never trump" movement fell apart after ted cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the republican nominee would guarantee a democratic white house, because it’s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. it’s hard to isolate a single cause for kennedy’s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. in the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between bernie sanders and the democratic party becomes an outright split, democrats risk throwing the election to trump, through in-fighting and division. a terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. with all this said, even the most probable scenario here—that trump and clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot. partisanship has a tight hold on american voting behavior, and it’s hard to imagine how trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. in fact, the very presence of trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. the economy is middling, president obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and clinton would be a third term for democrats. and their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election—partisanship, demographics, and economic performance—to create favorable terrain for democrats. it’s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. at the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, john f. kennedy and richard nixon were neck and neck. clinton’s biggest weakness in the nbc news survey of registered voters is with sanders’ backers who haven’t crossed the threshold to team clinton. they’re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any republican or any democrat. this would give him teetering democratic states such as new hampshire, pennsylvania, and wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: florida, ohio, and virginia. let’s say you don’t trust the models (they couldn’t predict trump, after all). if not for that downturn, there’s a fair chance nixon would have become president. it’s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching ronald reagan’s performance in 1984. there’s one last thing that could deliver the white house to trump: a divided democratic party. the answer is easy: he wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. trump is deeply unpopular with black and latino voters, as well as with women and young people. if sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and democrats lose. he’s made real ground on hillary clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the republican party behind his candidacy. it would mean trump persuaded millions of democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for president obama. that trump is a poor bet for november doesn’t mean he couldn’t win. it could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving trump an advantage. given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the republican. still, with a smile from fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), trump can win. and what are the prospects this year for a generic republican nominee? how would trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? in which case, both clinton and trump become generic nominees. and consider this: on average, the united states sees a recession every five years. joe raedle/getty images at this moment, polls show a strong upswing for donald trump’s campaign. you just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a trump loss. if anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it’s a recession. but humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren’t. or given the candidates, it could be a wash. clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. one is all we need for president trump. he turns out white voters in historic numbers. but by october, kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. a sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. it could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping clinton. you see this in the most recent polling. and finding an answer here isn’t too difficult. (you can play with the numbers over at realclearpolitics.) if history is any indication, however, it won’t be. which raises an obvious question: how would it happen? this continued into the summer and the early fall. at the top of the list is demographics. easier to imagine is higher white turnout. but clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. in other words, it’s not happening. if this persists, it’s dangerous. party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. at least, that’s what i think. what are those conditions? say hello to president trump. but it’s possible. so let’s table this one. how trump could win. jamelle bouie jamelle bouie is slate’s chief political correspondent. then what? he could. he won. we’re due.
though ratu’s baby is a great moment of hope for the sumatran rhinos, the population is still threatened by its two biggest foes: poaching and loss of habitat. ratu, a rhino that lives at the sumatran rhino sanctuary in indonesia, is now mother to a little miracle. a very special baby was just born in indonesia, and people still can’t believe he’s real. with only 100 left in the world, these beautiful creatures are seriously on the brink of going extinct. the beautiful sumatran rhinos are one of the most endangered animals on the planet. once she had her son, though, she calmed down and became a very attentive mother. and when you see what it is, you won’t want to take your eyes off it for a second! her son, andatu, was born in 2012, the second sumatran rhino born in indonesia in 128 years! according to irf executive director dr. susie ellis, sumatran rhinos are one of the fasted declining species on the planet. in fact, ratu’s baby boy has now increased the sumatran rhino population by an entire 1%. it may seem hard to believe, but this is how crucial she is to her species’ survival. mama ratu once had a reputation as the feistiest, most difficult-to-handle rhino at the sanctuary. once you see this cute little face, you want to shower him with attention and love, too! ratu delivered her son on a rainy day, and boy, is she a welcome sight! they were just declared extinct in the wild in malaysia, and now exist only in indonesia. but the international rhino foundation recently announced a new breakthrough for this troubled species. let’s hope these beautiful creatures have a bright future ahead of them!
they’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young dream’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens. well, in nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when donald trump entered the race for the republican presidential nomination. while generally more appreciative than other americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally. finally, while many in washington will often try to compare latinos with african-americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests latinos are more comparable to other catholic immigrant groups, like the irish and italians. in states like nevada, colorado, texas, utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (new york-boston-washington), there were many average latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to trump and his promise to "make america great again." you may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs" and "bringing crime," and that they were "rapists," criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, "some are good people." like many other americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning. he thinks that hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to hispanics because his years in business have taught him that hispanics are especially hard workers. in fact, if trump is ultimately the republican nominee, it will almost assure a latino landslide for hillary clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the latino vote. for instance, they all seem to think that latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. they’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. and, finally, it is worth noting, most latinos weren’t even on the table for republicans in nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered democrats. strange but true why the republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with latino voters in nevada—and win the white house as a result. that is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: "if these voters think like americans, they’ll vote for trump. the latino community in the united states—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is mexican or mexican-american—is highly aspirational. now, if you look at the entrance polls out of nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about latinos. they might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion. in fact, trump would often point to early polling from nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with hispanics, which is what happened. according to cnn entrance polls, among latino republican voters in the silver state, john kasich got 4 percent, ted cruz 18 percent, and marco rubio 29 percent. besides, we are talking about just latino republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of nevada. the 54 million latinos in the united states—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in november. i can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by trump’s strong showing with latinos. it’s the same party that has won the majority of latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: the democratic party. two weeks ago, i wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of "latinos for trump." that piece was criticized by everyone from white democrats to latino activists to republicans supported other candidates. the first is trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with hispanics. besides, when trump blasts mexican immigrants as criminals, many latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else. next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes. like trump, these latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system. this was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. latinos don’t want to apart from america, and they aren’t in conflict with america. in fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about latinos. and they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other. like their european immigrant brethren, latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. still, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in nevada, or its significance. and many of those voters will be in three battleground states—nevada, colorado, and florida. now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor. no republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of latino votes. yes, donald trump won latinos over marco rubio and ted cruz. in the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president. meanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the "latinos for trump" story. and what about trump’s inflammatory comments about mexico and immigration along our southern border? if they think like latinos, they won’t." that’s hardly a representative sample of latinos across the country. now, here’s what happened in nevada. they want better lives for themselves and their children. the other person who saw this coming was me. but first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. they are fiercely patriotic americans who nonetheless identify as latino. granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. we know about the reagan democrats. ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. much of it fell into their blind spot. they are the essence of america. they want to be trump. trump got an astounding 44 percent. the east coast media don’t get latinos. neither do the political parties. they don’t hate trump. trump has a theory. behold, the trump latinos. they don’t settle. we need to unpack that. they want success. here’s why. it’s complicated. not true.
"consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting," the press release read, "while also recognizing the opportunity provided by the web for integration of text with audio and visual elements to strengthen story-telling and provide information and analysis." while websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the pulitzer prize board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content. pulitzer prize makes major change the pulitzer prize has broadened eligibility in feature writing and investigative reporting to include online and print magazines, the pulitzer prize board announced in a press release on monday. "he envisioned that future generations would make changes in the plan of award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.' but as an increasing number of americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense. in the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a pulitzer in any category. "pulitzer’s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism," pulitzer prize administrator mike pride said in a statement. increasingly, online and print magazines have expanded their mission. it’s time to enlarge the tent again."
yet late in the debate, trump's presence dissipated slightly, opening a spot for marco rubio, who used his increased time to take on cruz, who he sparred with most frequently in the previous debate. | ap photo ted cruz dominated talk time at the gop debate ted cruz commanded the rhythm of thursday's gop debate, mixing extended barbs directed at donald trump with his typical stump speech maxims. halfway through thursday's slugfest it appeared rubio would be mostly shunned by his opponents, but he used an almost two-minute segment to air a litany of cruz's flip-flops on immigration, which cruz parried. the final count had cruz speaking the most for the third straight debate, finishing at 18 minutes and three seconds. trump still spoke for a significant segment of the debate, sticking to a steady routine of interruptions without getting tested too seriously. the debate has seen a quality-over-quantity approach from ted cruz as he intensifies his criticisms of donald trump. and the candidate who spoke the most at the #gopdebate is ... trump, drawn into duels with cruz, didn't back down, calling the texan's comments about new yorkers "insulting" at one point. the ever-muted ben carson finished last, speaking for just eight minutes and 25 seconds. trump came in second with 17 minutes and 8 seconds. rubio spoke for just over 14 minutes. there wasn't a subject or segment cruz didn't wiggle into. noah weiland is a researcher at politico .
a paper published in thejournal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports researchers – from japan’s meteorological research institute and tohuku univeristy – now believe the asteroid struck the yucatan peninsula in mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. scientific reports journal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports the independent. it is thought that only 12 per cent of life on land lived through the aftermath of the asteroid impact, whereas 90 per cent of freshwater species managed to survive. the amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees celsius on land for about three years. the accepted theory was that the impact caused vapours of sulphuric acid in the sky, which reflected sunlight, leading to global darkness, near-freezing conditions and widespread acid rain. however, the team from tohuku said: if this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. the researchers wrote: small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer – dinosaurs did not. scientists now know what really wiped out dinosaurs wikipedia a new study has provided an updated theory about how the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago. also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. wikimedia experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had died out while other reptiles – like the ancestors of crocodiles – had survived. these different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. dark times. literally.

syda productions/shutterstock though there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the internet – largely led by english tabloids – has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from copenhagen university hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man’s sperm count by as much as thirty percent. for instance, back in the 1980s, researchers added a variety of coca-cola products to sperm in an attempt to see if it reduced their swimming ability, but ultimately did not find enough evidence to support this. a number of other studies have in the past attempted to find a connection between excessive soda drinking and poor sexual health in men, though most have found no concrete proof of any link. how these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as the cause, after finding no connection between caffeine in other drinks and sperm count. though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes. according to this study, drinking fizzy drinks can have a disturbing effect on your penis drinking too much of the black stuff could leave you with not enough of the white stuff. as such, they conclude that there is a high probability of a connection between soft drinks and soft penises, though they can’t confirm this without conducting a long-term study. for instance, they explain that high sugar intake could cause some of the blood vessels in the penis to become clogged up with fat, impeding blood flow and making it harder to get an erection. exactly why this has suddenly become so widely talked about is a bit of a mystery, since as far as we are aware there is no new research to speak of. after examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. however, the findings of the study are worth bearing in mind if you happen to be a lover of the self-appointed "real thing" (and a man). more recently, researchers published a report in which they listed several reasons why drinking too much soda could potentially cause erectile dysfunction.
you won’t believe what 11-time olympic medalist ryan lochte eats for dinner every friday looks like even world-class athletes have a cheat day or two. "i have a weakness: yellow starbursts, and i haven’t had one in about two months," lochte confesses. lochte explains, "when i was a kid, all the other kids loved the cherry and the strawberry starbursts, and the yellow ones were always left. he says, "i’ve been in training for 22 years and it’s my cheat day. at an event on tuesday at west charlotte’s thomasboro academy with his personal chef glenn lyman, competitive swimmer and 11-time olympic medalist ryan lochte divulged details on his occasional indulgences when it comes to food, reports the charlotte observer. "imagine," says lyman, "how many more gold medals you might have won had you not eaten pizza and wings every friday for your entire life." he has a weekly cheat day in which he treats himself to pizza, chicken wings, and a mountain dew every friday. so i said to myself one day ‘i got to try these.’ and i loved them." i’ve been doing it since i was 9 years old. yellow starburst isn’t lochte’s only weakness. i’ve only missed it six times." lyman adds, "i hide them from him around the house." i refuse to give it up." in response, lochte says, "no. a man after our own hearts.
"rapid changes of attitudes in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation have led many voters -- particularly the older and less-educated ones -- to feel left behind in their own countries," the wef said in its annual risk report. trump's approach amounts to a rejection of "american exceptionalism," the idea that the u.s. should actively promote democracy, civil rights and the rule of law around the world, according to ian bremmer, president of eurasia group. "the fact that the country that has been the linchpin of the global order since [world war ii] is no longer available for service, that is absolutely the top risk in the world today," added bremmer. bremmer said trump sees international cooperation in purely transactional terms: "if there's not an obvious, near-term benefit for the u.s. ... it's not something the u.s. should be doing." "leaders in beijing are vastly more experienced, but we have little precedent for how they may react if pushed and provoked by the u.s. on issues where china is most sensitive," moran and gilholm wrote. "as of january, when trump takes the oath of office, the feeling is no longer mutual," wrote andrew gilholm and michael moran of the consultancy control risks. and the west won't want or be able to muster a serious response -- trump's not interested, and eu leaders are either too weak or tired of sanctions," bremmer said. despite real policy differences, the two powers have avoided major conflicts in the past in order to protect their crucial trade and investment relationship. the analysts said it's unclear how the relationship will play out should trump implement the anti-china policies he promised during the campaign. weak economic growth, rising inequality, wild weather, data fraud, anti-establishment politics and forced migration are just some of the potential flashpoints highlighted by the world economic forum ahead of its annual meeting in davos. wef said that while inequality between countries has been decreasing over the past 30 years, inequality within many developed nations -- including the u.s. and britain -- has risen. trump has criticized nato allies for not spending enough on defense, promised to scrap free trade agreements and questioned u.s. involvement in conflicts abroad. here's a list of 2017's biggest risks, according to wef, eurasia group and control risks. russian disruption a reduced geopolitical role for the u.s. could further embolden moscow to "act as a rogue and disruptor," said bremmer. and president vladimir putin won't be chastened by allegations that he ordered russian intelligence agencies to disrupt u.s. elections. the president-elect is an unpredictable political force who could dramatically change u.s. priorities at home and abroad. experts say the relationship between the world's two biggest economies could change radically in 2017. trump has threatened beijing with punishing tariffs and even questioned the u.s. position that taiwan is part of "one china." the group pointed to brexit and trump's election as clear signs of a backlash against the status quo. if you thought last year was rough, just wait: 2017 promises to be a year of extreme risk. an american retreat from the world stage is bound to cause problems for its allies. what are the biggest risks the world faces in 2017? in europe, france, germany and the netherlands will all hold major elections in 2017. angry voters widening gaps between rich and poor, and old and young, are fueling feelings of resentment. china has a lot to worry about in 2017. populist and eurosceptic parties could make major gains, and further undermine the region's precarious political balance. an inward turn for the u.s.? "he'll hack away at the french and other upcoming european votes. and then there's donald trump. china - opportunity or risk?
looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown: idiomatic: 22% literal: 70% other person's name: 8% this sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word jesus refer to the religious figure, "jesus" would still have more literal tweets than "kanye," and the proportion of tweets referring to jesus appears to be much higher than that. looking to minimize instances of other people named jesus and kanye, we decided to start our search comparing "kanye west" with "jesus christ": according to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original tweets (no retweets, no replies), "jesus christ" had 3,936,585 mentions, while "kanye west" had 4,541,349 mentions. that being said, the idiomatic jesus christ doesn't directly refer to the person jesus christ, while kanye west refers to the person kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then jesus christ's numbers are significantly smaller. 2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: ascension thursday 3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: easter sunday 4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: good friday 5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: st. george's day jesus christ's biggest day-of-the-week was sunday, while kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was monday. this search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of "jesus christ" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic "jesus christ" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions. we looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for "jesus christ" on twitter using the twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of "jesus christ" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. there are a lot terms twitter users use to reference jesus: there's the broad "jesus," which includes other people named jesus, the more specific "jesus christ" and foreign language versions -- jesucristo in spanish, gesù cristo in italian. kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to kanye west as kanye west while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference jesus. never, though, has west's embrace of the son of god been as fervent as his last album, "yeezus," which title is a portmanteau of west's nickname (yeezy) and jesus. here, again using "kanye west" vs "jesus christ," kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. usage of the exclamatory "jesus christ" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to christianity, so it may still be a good signal for jesus's popularity among the twitterati. so, it looks like jesus is "the most high" on twitter -- except for justin bieber, who trumps jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term "bieber" during the same period. kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). with kanye bringing a jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, the huffington post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of kanye and jesus in the popular zeitgeist. since jesus doesn't have a genuine twitter account, and kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. when you look at the stream of "jesus christ" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the "jesus christ" tweets are idiomatic ("i just stubbed my toe. the album also features a direct kanye-jesus comparison in the song "i am a god": "i know he the most high / but i am a close high." "kanye," which includes other people named kanye (though there are far less people named kanye than jesus), "kanye west" and @kanyewest. where "kanye west" is more popular than "jesus christ" kanye west has used jesus christ in his art since "jesus walks." while west's total was greater overall, on a typical day, kanye didn't have more tweets than jesus. when you break it down by region, mentions of "jesus" are more popular than "kanye" pretty much everywhere. breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about kanye (green states). in fact, jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year). when comparing jesus and kanye on twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison? jesus had significantly more tweets: kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. although there are some residents in the u.s. who speak foreign languages, jesus christ is generally used as the identifier. to do this, we analyzed a year's worth of twitter data (from oct. 21, 2012 to oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service topsy. the day after his "blood on the leaves" performance at the vmas 2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. we also haven't accounted for different names for jesus in languages other than english. so, using "kanye west" vs "jesus christ," their twitter mentions are pretty close. (there are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like yeezy and 'ye.) kanye west's top five days: 1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. jesus christ's top five days: 1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: christmas. some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @jesus. when did users tweet the most about jesus and kanye? west feuds with kimmel on twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi. so what happens if you compare "jesus" vs "kanye"? the announcement of his baby's name: north west. #notblessed") and don't actually refer to the literal jesus christ. only looking at the united states offers a clearer picture. but what about the foreign language tweets? there are a lot fewer version of "kanye." kim kardashian announces she's pregnant with west's baby. pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper. the official release of his album "yeezus." 3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. 4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. 5) 6/21/2013, 48192. how much smaller? jesus christ! new years eve.
"we speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency," the paper reads. a recent study proves that cheating is not a one-time thing, and that person will probably cheat on you again. when a person engages in dishonesty purely for the benefit of another it may be perceived as morally acceptable. it further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught. because some people just love to cheat and it can happen for multiple reasons - they found a better match, they just weren't loyal, the opportunity of something different, emotional incompatibility, intimacy, etc. we all remember happy faces, exhilaration, and sheer elation when two folks mutually get into a relationship, but half of them get thrown in predicament, simply because of infinitely. each time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced. it's a region that's associated with emotions and plays "a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal." the study focused on the part of the brain called amygdala, which is the supplier of negative responses. gliding in a pool of despair will drag them further into it, making it harder to cope. in all this, the person on the receiving end should always be open-minded -- open to options, positivity, optimism. the venerable saying is backed in this journal titled "the brain adapts to dishonesty". "when participants were dishonest for the benefit of someone else, dishonesty at a constant rate was observed," the study says. but let's keep the mental rationale aside and see what science has to say about it. we’ve all heard the same, tired cliche about infidelity: "once a cheater, always a cheater." this absolute favourite thing in the world apart from murders or robbery is as evil as any other violation. but sadly, despite cheating, most cheaters feel belaboured when caught. it further responds to an individual when they lie. and now science is backing it. so, don't be a cheat. because, science cheating sucks! why do you ask? how convenient, right?

http://lions.gt/mechanictrailer a photo posted by jason statham (@jasonstatham) on jul 3, 2016 at 5:10am pdt a photo posted by jason statham (@jasonstatham) on according to bodybuilding.com, the 49-year-old has two rules when it comes to hitting the gym: 1) "never repeat a workout - it is virtually impossible to go through a training plan without repeating the exercises but each and every workout would be varied. here's how jason statham has managed to stay ripped all these years theladbible http://www.theladbible.com/ http://www.theladbible.com/assets/images/theme/logo.svg july 26th 2016 8.9k shares featured image credit: jason statham via instagram it seems that ever since he broke into the film industry back in 1998, starring in guy ritchie's cult classic lock, stock and two smoking barrels, jason statham has been a fucking badass. whatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body. he told men's health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each. for a weight based high intensity workout, statham's trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times. the icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol. he then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag. so, unfortunately, you're not going to get as stacked as the transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab. of the exercises, bodybuilding.com says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmer's walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows. if you eat carbs later in the day, it's harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories. "i'm certainly no vegan, but there's this little place down on sunset that i'll go to, the california vegan, and they do a really good steamed vegetable and brown rice," he said. credit: universal pictures well, the 49-year-old, who has studied wing chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime. he goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein. the times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase. this will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training. statham's high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs. the time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured. and by strict, i mean fucking strict; this is jason statham we're talking about, he's a no nonsense kind of bloke. therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated." in an interview with men's health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs. all of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. he told bodybuilding.com that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises. for lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, it's not going to sound too appealing. the workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down. growing up, statham was a typically sporty lad, and was actually introduced to football by none other than vinnie jones, his childhood friend, who'd he later act alongside. the martial arts expert believes in never repeating the same workout as he feels you see more results from varying your exercises. statham only eats 'good food', saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again. he went on to be a part of britain's national diving squad for 12 years, and even represented england at the 1990 commonwealth games. 2) "take notes of everything - as you progress through the workouts, it is inevitable that you will get fitter, faster and stronger. statham was also a keen diver in his younger years, starting when he was just 11-years-old. now, 18 years later, the 49-year-old is still ripped to fuck. the snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment. eventually he was picked up by an agency called sports promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for french connection. he also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon. but how's he maintained it for all of these years? "you put that in your body and you feel good. jason's workout plan is a different kettle of fish. therefore it's hard to pinpoint a solid plan. anyone else out of breath just thinking about this? he specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad. statham ripped as fuck in death race. there's nothing better than that stuff." words by mark mcgowan words by mark mcgowan words by mark mcgowan no wonder he's fucking jacked. or try a nice miso soup.
this was a touchy process, as he was changing the angle of the inside of the attic without compromising the structural integrity of the beams. what a man did with his useless attic is unbelievable it's not often that you find a completed diy project that leaves you drooling, but this might be the exception. one man had some empty space in his attic, so he decided to fix it up into the man cave of his dreams. so he chipped away at a wall that was adjacent to stairs that led down into the garage. then, he needed to find a way to create a new entrance into the attic. instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp. he used this opening as the new entrance up into the attic. more importantly, there would need to be stairs into the cool new attic. he planned on adding a roof window that would hopefully result in some extra light. the existing opening is in the middle of the hall, which wouldn't work out. olivier-fr even added a very fitting door with a nautical window. he modified the angle of the roof with some beams. he switched out the door for a sliding one to save space. and this is what it used to look like. this is basically a treehouse for adults...which is why it's so great! olivier-fr got the whole family involved when it came time to build some furniture. the new attic was covered with wood paneling and painted. this is the door, which didn't lead to anything, at first. most other attic rooms just pale in comparison to this awesomeness. the wood of the stairs was a dark exotic grain. as crazy as that sounds, it actually turned out awesome! looking good, even without the full coat of paint. then, he added a railing as a safety precaution. here's the stair frame, soldered and painted black. this is the attic's original entrance. manipulating pre-engineered structural beams like this could be very dangerous. it's hard not to feel at least a little jealous. what it looked like from the outside. a television, sound system, and some cool wall hangings were all necessary. after the whole place was painted, carpeting went down. plus, a fouton, weight bench, and some lounge space. to stabilize the temperature, lots of insulation was added. he enclosed the stairs in a small capsule. the view from the attic window. he converted it into a boat's cabin. here are the stairs from above. plus, a heating/cooling unit. here's the skylight. don't try this at home yourself. time to decorate! installed and ready to go!

but there’s something else i have to say as a human being, and that’s that you only get one life and you have to live it, and if we have to eventually pass to a better life then it has be an honest one. and i’m going to tell you something, fernando, i’m not a saint but i’m also not the little devil that many think i am or that people want to make others think i am. that is until for decades rumors of the singer’s sexuality swirled, even as he filled arenas and his records sold millions of copies worldwide. the artist responded with a perfect analysis of what truly matters: that’s what’s most important because your worth isn’t based on the things that other people can hold against you. for decades rumors of the singer’s sexuality swirled, even as he filled arenas and his records sold millions of copies worldwide. what juan gabriel said when asked if he was gay will blow you away juan gabriel’s songwriting was only matched by juan gabriel’s songwriting was only matched by his showmanship . juan gabriel responded saying, "art is feminine... look, if you’re handsome and young and beautiful, well, people are always going to say that you’re gay." that is until univision reporter fernando del rincón asked juan gabriel point blank if he was gay during a televised interview in the early 2000s. they say we’re living difficult times, that people are curious and they want to know more, but people also aren’t dumb. when del rincón asked if the singer was gay, juan gabriel laughed and questioned why he was so interested. during his 45 years as a recording artist, "el divo de juárez," who died sunday from a heart attack in santa monica, california , was best known for gliding across the stage when he performed with elegance and unapologetic flamboyance. i’ve also been in glory and perhaps i’ve made my own hell, but i certainly don’t take anyone down with me. "i’ve learned during my life that if i am in hell, i make my own glory. juan gabriel then went on to criticize television for trying to delve into something that shouldn’t be of interest to anyone. i have no reason to tell you, and others, something that is not of interest to you. then he gave a simple answer: "they say that what you can see you don’t ask, son." "i think, today, television is asking too many loaded questions, pushing further for the ratings," he told the journalist. the journalist first quoted a mexican historian who had commented on how the artist "explored the feminine side" when on stage. i think i am juan gabriel, who has given so much with my songs. when the journalist said that what he saw was a successful singer. what i say is what i feel, whether anyone likes it or not. and [i’ve learned] that i am not a liar. let others worry about their own lives, and let the rest of us live." people are smart, they’re not dumb... because everything that one does is what stays, what matters. i think i am an artist. actions are what’s more important. watch the full spanish-language interview in the video above. to transcend and be yourself.
mic has reached out to for comment, wrote "so my boss didn't like me wearing my hair in a ponytail every day ... nor my hair in a scarf ... nor my hair in pigtails," rivas, whohas reached out to for comment, wrote on facebook , in a post that has now been deleted. there are already several incidents of women in the workplace being told that they can't wear their hair in cornrows or headscarves in the meantime, rivas said that she has reported her boss to the u.s. although it's unclear what will happen at rivas' workplace, or what will happen to her boss, it's great to see a woman fighting the system with a little bit of creativity and a whole lot of humor. this woman reacted to her new racist workplace dress code in the best possible way it is 2016 and people are still super concerned about what women wear to work. just be clean and pressed,'" rivas continued, posting a picture of how she usually showed up to work, which shows rivas in a neat cream suit, a patterned blouse and a headscarf. so far, rivas has posted nearly 20 photos of herself in full-on costume and her facebook post has been shared more than 20,000 times, with commenters applauding her creativity. in banning "cultural head wraps" rivas's boss joins the many other employers who have taken to policing how women of color dress or appear at work. for example, here is rivas dressed up like a star trek character.... ...and here she is at work as a fast food worker... ...and here she is as the superhero storm. while still abiding by the new dress code, rivas is now showing up to work in head-to-toe costumes. if you're a female meteorologist, you can't wear anything clingy or cleavage-baring — and if you do, prepare for lots of sexist letters about it. "i have come to work each day in an outfit that fits the guidelines she laid out ... just ... not quite the way she expected," she wrote. june j rivas learned this last week after her boss complained first about her wearing a ponytail to work, and then wearing a headscarf. rather than back down, her boss issued a brand new memo regarding the office's dress code, with special attention to headscarves. now, even if you just have a regular old office job, with cubicles and all, headscarves are problematic. equal employment opportunity commission and while they investigate, she decided she'd have a little bit of fun. "no any of above, plus no straps, hats, sandals, cleavage, lace, and even (and i quote) 'cultural head wraps.'" "i hope the powers that be get knocked down a peg or two," one commenter wrote . "we now have a dress code," rivas wrote. we've seen it at fox news, where you still can't bare your shoulders . "i filed a harassment complaint against her as our contract states 'no dress code . fight the system of office clothing." another: "i love this so much.
users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic. when digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account. currently, 70 percent of digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel. rhoads, a 37-year-old los angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns. bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make digit’s user interface far more conversational, to "humanize it" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it. when the product moved out of pilot mode, in february 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month. digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on facebook messenger’s platform, so users can just use facebook to communicate with it. an algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. also on the product horizon is having digit’s algorithm figure out how to "move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] "i just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it," said rhoads, who says she is "like a squirrel" in her approach to saving. take the goal function, for example: if users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money. "one day, it would be awesome to say, ‘hey, digit, am i ok for retirement?’ and all digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji." this bot has saved users $250 million, and it's coming to facebook messenger late last year, just in time for christmas shopping, rachel rhoads got a nice surprise. since digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the san francisco startup’s mission. in two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, ethan bloch. bloch said interest rates "are not a huge deal" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums. that, bloch said, will let the company "be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. "we want to make digit understand more—not as broad as alexa or siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money," he said. "if an account is labeled 'charlie’s education fund,' i’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled 'savings,'" bloch said. it painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because "i like to pretend the saving is not happening." digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago. "because of that, digit and products like acorns, venmo, betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers." digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. but after a series b round of fundraising led by venture capital firm ribbit capital, digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. the company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets. (updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.) the company is now working on what bloch called "the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program." "banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data," bloch said. rhoads said they’re "cute texts" with "some personality" and "not annoying at all." the big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust digit to do?" another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. one of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back. that kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon. after text messaging came ios and android apps for users. its product is simple. behavioral finance underlies much of digit’s design. and maximize gain," bloch said. there are hitches.
speaking about her trial, she said: i want to go back and smack myself and ask: ‘what were you thinking mary beth?’ if convicted, mary beth will face up to two-years in prison and will become a registered sex offender. teacher reveals the sexts and love notes that led to affair with pupil a 24-year-old female high school teacher from iowa, who was arrested for having a sexual relationship with one of her students, has bared all in a new interview. mary beth haglin turned herself into the police back in july, but now she insists that she was ‘swept off her feet’ by the anonymous 17-year-old male student. if convicted, mary beth will face up to two-years in prison and will become a registered sex offender. speaking to inside edition, the substitute teacher said: he would come into my classroom, grab a post-it, write something and stick it to my desk on his way out. and mary beth fell for his way with words, having sex with the minor ‘almost every day’ at a nearby car park and sending numerous revealing selfies. but their lustful, and massively illegal, romance came to an abrupt end when the pair were spotted by another student and haglin was fired and charged with sexual exploitation. however, the teacher claims that the relationship was more than just sexual – she believes it was love. she then quickly handed herself into police and is set to be tried on november 14. we met several times a week, not every time was just to have sex. i thought in my mind this was some sort of real relationship. one read, ‘i love you so much, my empress’. there were times we would sit and talk. he would always call me ‘my empress’. she added: i was completely head over heels.
unfortunately (and frighteningly), these batteries are prone to "violent reactions" when overheated and/or over-charged, which isn't outside the realm of possibility of happening given how fragile the encasings on some of these devices are. watch as this brave gentlemen perforates his phone's battery using the tip of a knife, causing a reaction that makes it explode into flames! global news reports that most phones and laptops use lithium-ion batteries like the one seen in this video because they're a lightweight, powerful option for small portable devices. while reactions like this are pretty rare, they do happen and they have killed people. what happens next made me jump out of my seat warning: don't try this at home! he pokes his phone with a knife. we can safely say we wereexpecting this to happen.
"we have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in nasa and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs," republican senator ted cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, "we have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in nasa and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs," republican senator ted cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, commented . with the potential chaos of a new president on the horizon, the senate committee on commerce, science, and transportation passed a bipartisan bill giving nasa $19.5 billion to continue working on a mission to mars. it also does not scrap the bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. the bill would allocate $19.5 billion in funds to nasa in 2017, but it has a critical mission for the space agency: send men to mars. the bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. the nasa transition authorization act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the senate as a whole, of course. it's official: we're going to mars in brief a bipartisan bill was passed by the u.s. senate committee that oversees nasa space projects. the bipartisan support behind the new bill shows that space exploration is an issue that all parties can agree is vital to our growth as a nation and a species. it also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the international space station (iss) from american soil no later than 2018. the priorities that we’ve laid out for nasa in this bill mark the beginning of a new era of american spaceflight," said an optimistic florida sen. bill nelson, senior democrat on the commerce panel. the bill requires that nasa make it an official goal to send crewed missions to mars in the next 25 years. "fifty-five years after president kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the senate is challenging nasa to put humans on mars. credits: nasa making it rain, nasa-style the senate is not giving nasa money just for the sake of exploration. it also does not scrap nasa’s controversial plans to send men on asteroids and collect samples by 2021. the budget allotted is the same as what was approved by house appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the senate appropriations committee. funds are on the way it looks like republican and democratic senators alike are keen on safeguarding america’s space programs. it does, however, require the space agency to regularly send progress reports to congress, justifying its $1.4 billion cost. now we just have to wait to see if it passes the senate. "the impact in terms of jobs lost, the impact in terms of money wasted has been significant." the obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for nasa. it is also a challenge, a mandate, actually.
according to guns n’ roses frontman axl rose, "sweet child o’ mine" was directly inspired by lynyrd skynyrd; when crafting the song’s nostalgic, strangely romantic feel, axl turned to jacksonville’s finest for a lesson in how to write straight from the heart and make it mean not just something, but everything: "for ‘sweet child’... photo credit: engadget.com all roads lead to skynyrd... no matter where you go in the rock and roll spectrum, all roads inevitably lead to lynyrd skynyrd – a band as fiercely respected for their ability to get to the heart of the human condition in the form of honest lyrics wrapped around soaring melodies as they are for their innovative approach to everything from guitar playing to crafting the perfect rhythm section, their influence is felt in every facet of modern rock music. in fact, lynyrd skynyrd played a huge role in the success of another iconic band as they made their rise to fame; los angeles rockers guns n’roses, who thanks to these jacksonville natives, achieved critical acclaim with their smash hit "sweet child o’ mine" from 1987’s appetite for destruction – but how? always setting the bar high for themselves and for future generations of bands with each album and each performance, the way that skynyrd has shaped the way rock music is made is possibly one of the greatest parts of the legacy they forged on that baseball diamond a lifetime ago. whether ronnie van zant would have liked guns n’roses, we’ll never know – but somehow, we think he’d be mighty pleased to know that the legacy he helped build is positively impacting the music world and inspiring artists to stretch themselves to achieve something great! we’ve been fans of lynyrd skynyrd for decades, and we’re always amazed at how far their influence stretches! 29 years ago, lynyrd skynyrd inspired this band's biggest hit - you won't believe who it is! i went out and got some old skynyrd tapes to make sure that we’d got that heartfelt feeling," reveals rose.
breaking: wikileaks founder reveals hillary clinton's way to promote her presidential campaign assange appeared via video link from the ecuadorian embassy in london as part of the ‘new era of journalism: farewell to mainstream international media’ forum in moscow.he said: "google is directly engaged with hillary clinton’s campaign" and claimed the technology giant used the us state department on a quid pro quo" basis. "what we have with clinton is someone who is a hawk but who has the tools of legal interventionism, a rhetorical cover to start wars, and someone who seemingly wants to start them... from wikileaks’ perspective hillary clinton is a problem in terms of war and peace." it seems much more to do with google’s feeling that it is part of ‘family america’ and that it is opposed to the chinese." "if google tweaks its algorithm to show more positive search results for a candidate, the researchers say, the searcher may form a more positive opinion of him or her." and she made the chart for the destruction of libya, she was involved in the process of taking the libyan armoury and sending it to syria." assange reiterated his claims that clinton is a "war hawk" that "seemingly" wants to start wars. "through five experiments in two countries... biased rankings in search results can shift the opinions of undecided voters by 20% or more, sometimes even reaching as high as 80% in some demographic groups. the founder and editor-in-chief of wikileaks added: "google is an intensely washington, dc-aligned company. "of course when she is in power... she is a problem for freedom of speech. "it [google] shows the will to use that at different levels. fortune reported last year that researchers had found that "google search rankings could potentially decide the outcome of an election". google, which has increasing control over the distribution channels,... is intensely allying itself with the us exceptionalism.

so, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, it's worth noting that betfair isn't the only online gambling site that's predicting a strong trump showing in the primary -- with clinton winning a narrow victory. the odds for clinton winning the democratic nomination are so overwhelming that a $100 bet would just earn you an extra $10 and that same bet on trump to take the republican nomination would pocket you just $25 more. here’s who professional gamblers are betting will become president online gambling might only be quasi-legal in the u.s., but that's not stopping offshore sites from letting people place their bets on who will be fighting for the oval office in november. big bets on clinton oddsshark, meanwhile, says data from bovada indicates you might be better served to just hold onto your money if you're considering getting some skin in the political game. (using data from online casino betfair.com , the site averages the current "bid" and "ask" prices to come up with the implied odds.) trump is given a 71% chance of winning the republican nomination, says the election betting odds website. put in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on clinton and she won, you'd see returns of $172.73. a $100 bet for clinton today would be worth $171.43, while a trump victory would turn $100 into $260. an average of six polls from news organizations on real clear politics shows trump leading the republican field with 33.2%. and oddsmakers are pretty convinced at this point that it's going to come down to donald trump and hillary clinton. clinton is given an 87% chance of sealing the democratic nomination by the site. and among democrats, clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of bernie sanders. take the odds for trump and that $100 would become $350. (marco rubio has 6/1 odds on that site, while sanders is far back at 12/1.) that's certainly better odds than either candidate is seeing in national political polls. paddypower.com currently gives trump 5/2 odds for winning the presidency. but it does show what many people perceive will be the final ballot. there is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds. she also is favored to win the general election by 55%. and perception, especially in public forums, sometimes has a sneaky way of becoming reality. clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8/11 odds. the other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct. but what about the polls? one actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters. should those two face off in november? not even remotely close. scientific?
although you can see her 81-year-old hands are gnarled by arthritis, she seems to peel back at least a decade when she glides over the keys. when this old woman turns up at a boring bus stop it’s not for a reason we might have thought. the world is listening, and not just listening to an "old" lady playing piano on the street, but listening to a musical genius. she knows she’s in a place where people are ephemeral – here one moment and then boarding a bus and disappearing. the death of her two daughters led to her current situation sitting near a bus stop bench, doing what she’s doing now. she transforms her sidewalk performance into a beautiful recital, a recital that we would pay good money to see again in a concert hall. this isn’t just a ploy to get people to cough up some coins while they wait for the bus. no, this is akin to a musical performance that people might see at the sydney opera house. watch as her arthritic fingers glide back and forth across the black and white keys like she’s a young woman again. she’s played at hotels all over australia and hasn’t let things keep her down. she’s been playing for a long time and knows what she’s doing. this old woman sat down at a piano at the bus stop. this musical piece was composed by natalie when she was just 13-years-old! it’s as though she channels and communicates the feelings of an infinite number of souls! what an outstanding, masterful performance and to know this is a raw improvisation boggles the mind! she sits down in her shabby overcoat and... starts playing the piano. it’s easy to understand why when you see how she performs. this original composition was written in 1960 and played in march of 2018. her performance is most important, and she won’t cheapen it for anyone. however, it isn’t just a bit of ‘chopsticks’! they’re certainly not places you go to for entertainment! recently she performed a piece called "you asked for me". who is she and what’s her name? just look at how she quickly mesmerizes a group of perfect strangers! if i were there, i’d be giving her a standing ovation after every song. so hypnotic and beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes, bravo natalie!! thanks for posting this memorable piece of music history! bus stops are usually incredibly bland and boring. she’s somewhat of a local legend there. prepare to have your breath taken away by her sudden and emotional display. perhaps we should put pianos on every sidewalk! she could be a shining example to us all about perseverance. it’s a form of catharsis. even in life’s hardships... never give up. she doesn’t compromise her artistic integrity, though. what a beautiful performance. where is natalie now? natalie hasn’t. she lives in melbourne, australia. what she does next? her backstory is fascinating. well, think again! no, indeed. meet natalie. really? chills!

"el chavo kart" will be created by efecto studios and published by slang games.
many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, vanguard's total stock market index fund (vtsax). i have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as i still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but i'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. i would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but i do not want to buy bonds right now, as the fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago). stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. first, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market. once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished. deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. i'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. for example, while i've read quite a bit about real estate investment, i'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as i apply those concepts to my first live investments. with less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds. livingston: as i am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. at 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. in our q&a, jp discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. too many people think alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on amazon to start their education. sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays. last month, i spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. when laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? jp (a pen name she goes by on her blog, themoneyhabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. that means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. there are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. livingston: i feel i've gotten pretty far on just two things.first, don't be afraid to say you don't know. you could be sitting on the beach drinking mai tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. livingston: your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you. jp livingston: my investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities. specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or ira, what would you say to them? investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information. livingston: as a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy? her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. the compound annual growth rate for stocks on the s&p index for the last 30 years has been 11%. maya kachroo-levine: you've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. in some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. you can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ. in some parts of the country like san francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. a heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs. interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. kachroo-levine: for those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey? livingston: you are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. they believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. kachroo-levine: what are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017? kachroo-levine: what are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy? here's how she's investing in 2017: in 2016, jp livingston celebrated her 28th birthday. say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. my priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people. i have to admit i don't know basic things all the time. there are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. this 28-year-old retired with a $2 million net worth. or what are the three things that could break this strategy? kachroo-levine: what are your financial/investment goals for 2017? (note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask what are the arguments against it? income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. kachroo-levine: what advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. people get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. there are a few key arguments for this strategy. has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion? bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. that's such a self-defeating way to start. a few of them are worth it. second: don't give up until you really feel you understand something. is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive celtic dance? more on forbes:  more on forbes:  more on forbes: money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. most of them are not). a few things: 1. real estate is hyperlocal like that. this interview has been edited for brevity. every strategy has some vulnerability. what are your priorities? cruise around on the reddit personal finance forum. momentum matters most. she also retired. there's no free lunch. 2. we're all lifelong learners.

why you shouldn't scare your cat with a cucumber you may have recently seen a viral video compilation of cats freaking out after they’ve been ambushed by a dastardly foe: the humble garden cucumber. according to iflscience, the cats’ fearful reactions—which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable—are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice. in these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around. and since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone. (animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator.) just don’t unexpectedly give it a cucumber—or for that matter, any other new item that might cause distress. while the cucumber isn’t stressful to you, it’s stressful to the cat. slowly introduce new toys and objects to your cat, as they’re a source of mental stimulation. in short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable. in worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days. however, national geographic reports that your cat’s fright is more harmful than hilarious. bottom line?
john and i are more or less the same age as harry in the play and i just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent. dumezweni also, i think the difference with a play is that you’re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. i met her first, and i already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the traverse theater in edinburgh when i was the director. thorne we all met in edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of "harry potter and the deathly hallows" as a starting point. but for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums i know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that i am playing hermione. tiffany there are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, i didn’t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. there was something in her eye — i thought, we didn’t say it’s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we’re on the right track. but we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. tiffany it will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on july 30, so that it’s not our secret to keep. what about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can’t create the kind of effects that happen in film? when we met to talk about the play, she asked, "what do you think the harry potter stories are about?" thorne we can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn’t do. it was only after the first book came out that i realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas. but you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that. why j. k. rowling endorsed ‘harry potter and the cursed child’ for the stage jamie parker you have abandonment issues, obviously. but if you don’t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we’ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge. ultimately it’s a theater piece, i’m a theater actor and doing a job as best i can. i’m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. noma dumezweni it does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story. we wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. how do you feel, jamie and noma, playing characters that a huge fan-base feel so possessive about? it is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon. being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. it’s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting? callender of course, jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of harry, so that helped. parker it’s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. parker when people ask, i just pull out a wand, and go, "i’m a wizard!" and what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online? and we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning? how is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel? tiffany all the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. thorne yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. you have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. we had a meeting and said, "why not two parts?" every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. she asks really specific questions; then i discovered people are quizzing her in her local supermarket. as an actor, it’s something i’ve never experienced before. she says, "just smile at me if i’m right." parker and you don’t get that much nowadays. callender i’m hopeful after seeing how people were about "star wars." tiffany how do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself? the exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. my daughter tries to guess what is in the play. how did it work having three writers in the mix? so often things are ruined because you know so much. it was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? jo would say, "this feels right, this doesn’t." we’ve got the imagination of the audience. you both share story credit with j. k. rowling. dumezweni i think jamie found it very intimidating. i said, "learning to deal with death and grief." tiffany my mum is the only problem. thorne all right, i’m a nerd. john tiffany jo rowling was incredibly generous. am i allowed to say that? dumezweni the weight of expectation is huge. dumezweni i’ve quite loved the secrecy. tiffany film has got green screen. tiffany no, not at all. although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. is it intimidating? with abandonment issues. they mostly protected the fans. it’s a cliffhanger. everyone else is fine. friedman that’s enough! [everyone laughs.]
well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn. rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. these are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on. although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone. this is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable  or unnecessary  to do. hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey. celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits. in fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days. researchers at the university of iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from north america and europe1. a comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by north shore medical center and massachusetts general hospital2. there's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. types of addiction smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. if you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. as much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. the smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an automatic behavior. gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. what is the easiest way to quit smoking? what is the easiest way to quit smoking? but can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? how hypnotherapy helps you quit so what will hypnotherapy do? this cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market. but going to a hypnotist can be expensive. the real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. they quit smoking using hypnotherapy. mar 04, 2017 what does matt damon, drew barrymore, ben affleck, charlize theron, and ellen degeneras all have in common?

"there had been a lot of talk about attacking smith, but most people wouldn’t go through with it as they don’t want time added on to their sentences," a source who witnessed the attack said. after hitting her daughter ayeeshia with so much force, the young girl died not too long after, having sustained a tear to her heart from trauma caused by a blow to her chest. mom who beat her toddler to death just learned a painful lesson of the term prison justice some justice has been served for twenty-three year old prisoner kathryn smith. while it’s unknown where her father or other family members were at the time, it seems as if the violent kathryn smith was unstoppable when inflicting trauma on her innocent child. while ten other inmates watched, the two women went to working beating smith, using a homemade knife to stab her and punch her numerous times. staff at the folson prison all agree that they don’t feel bad for the murderer and she deserved what she got. while smith howled in pain, the others watched for four minutes as the attack continued, resulting in a cut across her cheek that was an inch in length. smith, who was found guilty for murdering her 21-month old daughter in may 2014, has been sentenced to a minimum of 24 years. while prison staffers deny that there was a weapon used in the attack, they admit that the attackers will receive disciplinary action. everyone seemed to agree that this was definitely karma that was due to the murderer... "give them welcoming gals a nice spa day. and others added the following: "why would you disipline them, she got a taste of her own medicine. for justice being served for the child beaten and abused" "why isn’t she in for life? the little girl had been a victim to so much force that she bit through her own tongue. two inmates took justice into their own hands and brutally attacked the woman in a stairwell that was absent of video surveillance. but it was too late by the time she made it to the hospital. "but these two really went for it and left her in a bad way." and commenters on the story agreed that smith got what she deserved. she is doing her time at the foston hall women’s prison, which is a federal prison located in derbyshire, england. i hope they beat her once a week for as long as she lives!" "thank them for giving her a taste of her medicine. and smith’s fellow prisoner’s didn’t take what the murderer did lightly. neighbors of smith later said that they hear the girl’s voice shouting "stop mummy, stop daddy!" "i would’ve given them a reduction on their sentences." in a situation like this, prison alone isn’t enough punishment. "she got what she gave that precious baby girl. she deserves whatever comes her way. "what goes around comes around," said staffers regarding the karmic incident. they should be rewarded," said one commenter. ayeeshia died days later. peace to the wee one." no sympathy from me... what so ever!!"
based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by bloomberg view, it appears that pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion. it has been four decades since it was spun out of pacific life insurance co., a move that was made in part to allow gross a freer hand to manage the insurer’s fixed income portfolio. next month, free of gross and el-erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors. according to documents provided to bloomberg view by someone with knowledge of pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. but pacific life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to gross’s financial and managerial judgment. pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. * * * part of the reason for gross's longevity after the allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the "pimco premium." this same deal structure continued even after allianz purchased the 30 percent of pimco that it didn't already own from pacific life in the mid-2000s. the top three managers after gross and el-erian -- ivascyn, cupps and jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent gross packing to janus capital in september. despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as vanguard and blackrock, pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts. pimco also became the go-to company for the federal reserve and u.s. treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. that gave pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to bloomberg news, it appeared as if it was "the tail wagging the dog." using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as goldman sachs. mohamed el-erian, pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to gross, received $230 million (el-erian is a fellow bloomberg view contributor). if i were managing pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), i would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. in 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners "pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years." exclusive by @ritholtz: how much compensation the folks at pacific investment management co., better known as pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on wall street. former deputy chief investment officer daniel ivascyn -- now serving as gross's replacement as pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. (at least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship total return fund.) much of what we know about pimco stems from allianz se's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. bloomberg view's fee analysis suggests allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). beyond the sheer size of pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management. in a recent allianz presentation following gross' departure from pimco, the firm's new chief executive, doug hodge, stated, "we don't comment on matters of compensation." to put that figure into context, in 2013 gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company ceos made combined. gross’s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. in the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of lebron james, lionel messi, kobe bryant, tiger woods and roger federer -- together -- to be on par with gross. allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following gross out the door. the bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: allianz’ partial purchase left pacific life owning 30 percent of pimco. unbeknownst to allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money. let’s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. a subsequent column by felix salmon guessed that the average investment professional at pimco was making "roughly $7 million each" annually. almost 16 percent of pimco's revenue is a "material" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the u.s. pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive. pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. if ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now. since then, pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market. however, if there is going to be change, it can only come from pimco's big institutional customers. for one, pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- allianz -- for the past 15 years. janus, gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined. the market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. but while gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at pimco appear to remain firmly in place. a publicly traded german insurer, allianz has released some details about pimco’s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. wendy w. cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. i bet i even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings. in the u.s., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. anecdotally, stories abound of pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets. when competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. these giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to pimco’s president, jay jacobs, seem puny. that data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm’s revenue. on $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year. a pimco spokesman denied salmon's claim, responding that "the numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate." shareholders of the total return fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays. and the story doesn't end with pimco's two most visible (former) employees. perhaps it might also be a good time for pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. when allianz bought into pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. a subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. gross even managed to buy up lots of mbs's before the fed officially announced the programs. the 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. thus pimco -- based in newport beach, california, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. we can estimate earnings by looking at the largest pimco funds. (her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by gross.) * * * how pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk. so how much have pimco's top executives earned? actual bonuses at pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. douglas hodge, now the ceo, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. but allianz is a german company, subject to different regulations. guess how much money bill gross made last year? another item worth noticing: pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. the realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. why should they pay a pimco premium? pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. pimco currently manages about $2 trillion. pimco keeps the rest. why?
in an effort to drum up support for the controversial expansion of its headquarters, the social media giant is trying to give back to the community by building at least 1,500 housing units that can be rented by the general public—not just facebook employees. at the time, a wall street journal report referred to the project as being similar to a "company town," the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. as facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive pr agenda to convince people that facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate. despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it’s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can’t afford the rent. the new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on facebook’s part. most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. but while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it’s surely won’t be enough to fix the area’s greater socioeconomic problems. which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros. facebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years. that’s exactly what happened when facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the menlo park area, where its headquarters is located. facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families. in 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare. meanwhile, facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. for starters, it’s still unclear if facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. this january, the world bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. facebook is building apartments anyone can rent—but there's a huge catch image: getty facebook could be your next landlord. "many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs." sponsored this isn’t the first time facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. "some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks," the report said. secondly, it’s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. is facebook turning menlo park into a 21st century version of pullman? obviously, that doesn’t win mark zuckerberg many new friends in the area. but ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents. but there’s a catch. the proposal is still missing some important details, though. towns like pullman, illinois were created as "capitalist utopias." the employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. [wall street journal] [wall street journal] [wall street journal] it’s too soon to tell.

" furthermore, the doctors explained it to be a result of prolonged compression of nerves while squatting that had damaged her lower limbs' muscles and nerve fibers, made worse because of what she was wearing! source: kelownanow the funny side is that she was only helping a relative move house, and by kimber's words, had she worn something loose with elasticity, it wouldn't have happened. source: looksgud so, ladies, next time you put on those tight skinny jeans, avoid squatting and sitting for prolonged hours or you might end up in hospital! here is one such story of an australian girl whose only mistake was putting on a pair of tight skinny jeans! source: elitedaily a 35-year-old woman in melbourne, australia collapsed after her pair of skinny jeans stopped the blood flow in her calf muscles! this case was reported in the journal of neurology neurosurgery and psychiatry. it took her almost 4 days to recover from the numbness of her damaged nerves. and sometimes we come across stories that simply renew our definition of the same. we never know what might happen when. h/t times of india h/t times of india h/t times of india skinny jeans may look great but it could do this to your body. source: kytbinc who would have thought those skinny denims would leave someone unconscious? unfortunate occurrences are a common thing these days. indeed, a tough lesson learnt. shocking!
the most life-affirming tv episode of the year came from the most unexpected place in a year of doom and gloom, black mirror offered the world a truly wonderful episode  there’s a reason people keep banging on about the golden age of tv. after months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, kelly decides to upload her consciousness to san junipero, living out her days with yorkie. it transpires that yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in san junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode’s writer - charlie brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. season three offered some of the darkest episodes yet: just look at "shut up and dance", centring on a young man being blackmailed into doing terrible tasks for a group of hackers, featuring a horrendous final twist. eventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so kelly can formerly authorise yorkie’s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. because san junipero isn’t a real place: it’s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited. as the episode finishes, there’s a lasting shot of the computer servers keeping yorkie and kelly’s consciousness ‘alive' - the ‘tckr’ system. **spoilers ahead** in the episode, the wonderfully awkward yorkie - played by mackenzie davis - falls helplessly in love with kelly (gugu mbatha-raw) while partying at the californian beach resort san junipero. yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. kelly, however, rejects yorkie’s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to san junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. one show many consider to have a doom-mongering, pessimistic view of life is black mirror, the channel 4 show picked up by netflix. just look at 2016: atlanta, the people v oj, veep, the night of, stranger things, westworld... the list of brilliant tv shows goes on. many of the best - including the likes of bojack horseman, house of cards, and the walking dead - took viewers down dark, emotional roads. kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in san junipero. this is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. a reminder, that everything could be flicked off with the switch of a button/power outage. among those six new episodes, though, lies ‘san junipero', a somewhat enigma when it comes to the series. is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant? written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. yorkie is then uploaded to san junipero. the former saw an animated horse’s continued existential crises hit a new low. a haunting reminder to live every moment to the fullest. house of cards offered another petrifying take on the political climate. the latter show, for instance, saw numerous popular characters killed off. well, there’s one issue. how?
a creepy man in his underwear will remain on the campus of a women's college a lifelike statue of a nearly nude man will remain on the campus of a women's college in the boston area through the spring. it quickly created a stir on campus, and soon after there were calls from students for the statue to go, but the school says "sleepwalker" is going to stay put for the semester. the statue presents an obvious trigger for many students, who are forced to see it outside their window before they're going to sleep, or as they're on their way to class. sarah mahmood, a huffpost campus editor-at-large, explained why she supports the statue's removal: however, as a college community, wellesley's first priority should be the safety and well-being of its students. wellesley college president h. kim bottomly told the campus community thursday "we cannot destroy the artistic integrity of this exhibition by moving the sculpture, and also, we must do everything we can to support those students who find themselves deeply affected by it." pic.twitter.com/erf1ujcxka — ailis (@lishhh15) february 5, 2014 "we don't always have naked men at wellesley, but when we do, they're creepy." @thedavismuseum pic.twitter.com/o3qlxpcqew — polina soshnin (@polinasoshnin) february 4, 2014 nearly 1,000 people at the all female college have signed a petition on change.org asking for the school to remove it. according to the boston globe, it was placed in an area with a large amount of traffic and is hard to miss. welcome to wellesley, home of the women who will and this statue of a naked man. matelli responded to the controversy with his own criticism earlier this month, telling wbz, "i think that these people are misconstruing this work. the statue, titled "sleepwalker" by tony matelli, is part of an exhibit at the college's davis museum. pic.twitter.com/oot3ygbgjw — ali rondeau (@ali_rondeau) february 5, 2014 so this is what happens when guys come to @wellesley. i think they’re seeing something in this work that isn’t there. wellesley is our home, and students have a right to feel comfortable here. but who am i to say how people should react to this?" the statue was frequently called creepy, and triggering for sexual violence survivors. what will the wellesley townfolk think? please send your daughters here.
at december's global diabetes summit in berlin, dr sanjay kalra and his colleague dr ashok k das delivered a speech where they called type 2 diabetes "a ticking time bomb for india". back on the side of the road in calicut, i looked at padmanabhan's boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt. upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. by the time i arrived in calicut, at the house where i had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral. and worryingly, according to the world health organisation (who), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030. he'd disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when i told him that people had asked if they were from paris. ticking time bomb at december's global diabetes summit in berlin, doctors described type 2 diabetes as "scarier than hiv and malaria," causing more deaths than either. on the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that i had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up. india has, until it was surpassed by china, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having type 2 diabetes. the oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home. she smiled, and took my hand, like she had when i was a child, to walk me back to the house. and could i please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition. i often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. following the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from america, asked me to take a walk with her. he had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my family's fashion choices over the years. type 2 diabetes diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high. my grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. new data from the international diabetes federation estimates that 415 million people in the world have diabetes. 'we need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts," dr kalra told me. i asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in kansas. coconut trees line the streets, as the arabian sea sparkles to the west and the wayanad hills rise in the east. merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the west. calicut, where i was born, is a city on india's south-west coast. and as my aunt and i took our walk, we passed several street vendors. someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. it takes a seismic event to get a transglobal family together in one place. and everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar. for mine, it was the death of my grandmother in kerala. there's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in india. following our interview, dr kalra contacted me via whatsapp to offer a few extra facts. feeling slightly light-headed, i was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye. that's an estimated one in 10 of the world population. the international burden of diabetes is a much-told news story. "hiv is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours. currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease. "of what, he was only in his 50s, wasn't he?" and urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesn't discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds. "indian society frowns upon iv drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for tv)." for diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life. he'd cut and shaped my aunt's wedding sari. by 2040, the figure is expected to grow to 642 million. did i know that 11 january 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in toronto? he had to have his leg amputated. during the 13th century, calicut became a major port for the indian ocean trade route. it had belonged to a tailor named padmanabhan. "he died," my aunt said, following my gaze. a man was pulping sugar canes into a drink. i made myself another two more. and my niece's and nephew's. she had been our collective anchor. but is society enabling the deadly killer? he'd made my school uniform. "type 2 diabetes. and my cousin's. so sad."
i told him, ‘i never got to thank you for the meal,’ and he said, ‘oh my god, you saved my life!’ doctors have been unable to find a cause of the episode, but have released hall’s date and he’s now recovering at home. she followed paramedics to the hospital, and left her card with hospital staff so she could be updated by her date’s family. i turned my head to the side to give him some privacy and then the next thing i knew there were dishes falling onto my side of the booth. this woman saved a man’s life on their first date spilling pasta sauce on your top and lingering awkward silences are probably among our biggest first-date worries. after a few weeks of chatting on dating website plenty of fish, janine hall met her date at the cheesecake factory in missouri. hall said: he asked for a second date in the hospital. i checked and he had no heart rate quick-thinking hall, who’s a former respiratory therapist, began chest compressions and cpr - and his heart rate came back. she arranged with her date’s daughter to visit him in hospital soon after. they had a "wonderful meal and great conversation," hall told people. he asked for a second date in the hospital. and recover he must – he has a second date to attend. but one woman had far more to be scared about when her date nearly died. what means the most to me is that he works on his health and wellness right now. they continued talking after their meal, until hall’s date started coughing. and he remembered everything about our conversation at the restaurant. hall said: he had glazed-over eyes and blood was coming from his mouth. she told people: we weren’t eating so i knew he wasn’t choking. her date stood up and collapsed. i was extremely honored. he looked amazing.
"to the woman who recently visited gloria jeans in central for coffee and refused to be served by josie because of the colour of her skin," wrote jade, "you’re lucky she didn’t shit in your pie like that woman did in the help." this barista had the best response when a customer asked to be served by a white person josie ajak, a south sudanese woman who moved to australia with her parents when she was 8 years old, manages a coffee shop in cairns, far-north queensland. i told my staff that she is racist and that we won’t be serving her, while i continued serving other customers with a smile." last week, while making coffee, ajak was told by a customer that they "refused to be served by a black person". "there have been phone calls to my store from all over australia, from regular white australians just calling to say ‘hi’, show their support, [and] say they’re proud of me." "[i told her] ‘that’s fine’, with a smile, and she moved aside, waiting for a white person. "regardless of which colour, gender, age, size, and shape you are, we are all deserving of love and should be treated accordingly," she wrote. jade’s post was shared hundreds of times and racked up more than 1,000 comments from people offering their support to ajak. two days after the incident, ajak thanked all the people who had sent her messages of support and praise. "we are all just human and every individual who gives respect and kindness is worthy of it back." later that day, ajak’s friend and workmate jade posted to facebook about the interaction. "[the woman said] ‘get me a white lady,’" ajak told buzzfeed news. josie continued to serve other customers until the woman left. "i am so humbled," ajak told buzzfeed news.

but then the little girl says something so profound that it changes the mother’s mind and the two do exactly what the sweet girl wanted to do – they run through the rain... what the girl says, is a strong reminder of the need to avoid getting weighed down by little problems on a daily basis. the 4-minute film, narrated from the perspective of the old woman, shows a bunch of people sheltering from the rain when a confused little girl asks her mother ‘why can’t they run through the rain’. watch the amazing video and remember, next time it rains, run out in the rain and get a little wet. a short film called light rain directed by neil horner and written by bob perks reminds us that sometimes we should not worry about the little things. it also reminds us that there are people in worse conditions with real troubles in the world, before which our daily trivial hindrances are nothing. something makes this grandmother run out in the rain...when you see why, it will make you cry! so, the bottom line is that maybe things aren’t as bad as they first seem. her mother tells her that if they do, they’d be soaked. share the beautiful video with your friends, and share your views in the comments below.
the piece is being used to promote the sixth season of game of thrones, which is due to air in the uk on april 25. the result is a piece of art that’s about the size of two-and-a-half football pitches. you won’t believe how this game of thrones snow art was made it’s easy to look at some art and think "psch, i could’ve done that". to create the piece, beck trudged through 32.5km of heavy alpine snow, using just a compass to map his route. simon beck – a bona fide ‘white walker’ – crafted an incredible dire wolf portrait in the french alps, and the ‘how’ is what’s most impressive. then there’s this... an international snow artist has created the ultimate wintry tribute to hbo series game of thrones. according to digital spy, beck’s piece took an arduous 13 hours, requiring 64,800 steps in total.
we have to agree that if she can create a wedding dress this beautiful out of toilet paper she could certainly do something even more amazing out of actual fabric. that would be used for making clothing; however, one woman actually made a wedding dress out of toilet paper. the result was whimsical and beautiful, but we don't know that we would have been brave enough to let our elementary aged children decorate our clothing. another example of a beautiful and unique dress is one that a teenager hand-painted and wore to her high school graduation party. sure, toilet paper is white, but a wedding dress and toilet paper usually don't belong in the same sentence. she boiled charmin brand toilet paper in a pot on her stove and mixed it with glue to create the dress. then there's the story of a boyfriend who taught himself to sew so that he could make a prom dress for his date. we've seen a lot of beautiful dresses, and it's always interesting to see dresses made in unusual ways. mills decided to enter a toilet paper wedding dress contest from charmin, and she ended up getting the third place prize. many people are impressed with mills' dress and are even feeling inspired to do something creative themselves. for example, one elementary school art teacher had her students decorate her dress with their own artwork. this is the kind of thing you have to see to believe. it doesn't really seem like the kind of material (can we even call it material?) this veteran boiled toilet paper when she was at her lowest. i pray god blesses her with orders for wedding dresses! amber mills, a veteran marine, is used to challenges. they will be one of a kind for sure! first of all, she was a marine. but, today's story is about toilet paper. when you see why, it's incredible. that's the prettiest wedding dress ever! in his case, it actually led to paying gigs! i love your video amber! she should have gotten first place! one person wrote, "god bless you! i love this video!" that's love. the result was simply spectacular. you've jump started my dormant fashion designer in me! second of all, she has multiple sclerosis. she's also a mom. you're so inspirational! so creative! and absolutely beautiful!" another comment reads, "wow!

on a scale of one being low and 10 being high, gomez admitted to the hosts of boston's 103.3 amp tj show on monday that she rates her hotness differently depending on the day. the last time gomez was on the radio show she confessed that she had a celebrity crush on drake but quipped that her butt wasn't big enough for him. in her new chat with the hosts, gomez was asked to address rumors that the 28-year-old rapper has a line about her butt in yg's song, "who do you love." "i am trying to finagle my way onto her show, so, maybe that's how i'll find a way to work with her and be around her," gomez gushed. "i don't think that's about me," she said, adding jokingly, "how funny would it be if i just ask him? selena gomez is a total 10, but when she's asked to rate herself, the "good for you" singer is pretty humble. "i would say, like, [on] a premiere day, i would be a good nine," she said. gomez says she never hung out with the hip-hop artist and has no idea if that lyric is about her. the pop star -- who turns 23 on wednesday -- also revealed that she'd like a part on inside amy schumer after seeing the comedian's hit movie trainwreck. "and then, on my every day, i feel like a six. looks like gomez's hotness rating is on the up and up! "i'mma crush that a** even if it ain't too big," drake raps. 'hey, that butt line, is it about me?'" #selenagomez rates herself a what on the hotness scale?! i feel like a six or a seven." i think she's amazing." gosh, that sounds so bad. "i'm a huge fan.
maybe you’re feeling a little pms-y and angry about the dishes that never get put in the dishwasher, and for the love of all things holy, would it be that hard to change the toilet paper roll. you might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night—again!—to feed the baby, get the toddler a drink of water, or calm the big kid after a scary dream. your marriage will be ok. here’s a few other things no one tells you about marriage, the things that no one writes in your bridal shower scrapbook of clichéd-crock-of-shit advice: there will be fights. because when you share your freaking life with someone else—raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing netflix shows—it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then. you see cute couples at the park on the weekend, pushing their toddlers in the swings, and doubt they have ever gone through the low-grade suckiness that you’re in right now. because even though marriage has its hard and shitty days, marriage is also knowing you have someone on your side who will hold an umbrella over you when the shit hits the fan. they told you marriage would change over time, that there would be hard times, but they never said it would be like this. you measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons, and who spends more hours working in a dead-end job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. sure, our "hard times" all look different—because each marriage is different—but i assure you that we’ve all been through our own rocky stretches on the path to marital bliss. maybe you’re in a little rough patch, snapping at each other about leaving the fridge door open and forgetting to change the burned-out lightbulb in the bathroom. you might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas—again!—and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes round-trip to pick her up. you see the smiling picture perfect family photos on facebook and think to yourself, i bet they don’t fight about what kind of cereal to buy. you see other parents and wonder if they were up until 2 a.m. bickering about whose turn it was to get up with the baby. you will fight about whether to shop at walmart or costco, about whether your son needs a haircut, and whether your aunt josie is a racist or just an idiot. in fact, you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing. and not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids, the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy make-up sex. you will keep score of the number of socks on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and toilet paper rolls unchanged. and you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little "needy." but here’s something else no one might have told you: it’s ok that marriage is hard. maybe you had a fight last night and the night before that and the night before that. no one ever said it would be easy, but—dammit—no one ever said it would be this freaking hard either. you will fight about big things and little things and things you don’t even care about. you will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team. the truth is, some of the most amazing things in life—marriage and parenting among them—are really hard work. you will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote. because even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times, marriage is pretty fucking great. because here’s the thing that no one tells you: marriage is fucking hard. marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon. marriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. and marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on facebook with words like "soul mates" and "#soblessed." you will have drop-down, drag-out brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down. what no one tells you about marriage let’s cut to the chase, shall we? and making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better. and do you know what else they don’t tell you? it’s ok that marriage is hard and sucky sometimes. you might be exhausted and lonely, or feeling a little neglected lately. or maybe you’re dealing with some really fucking brutal shit. you will remember that you’re on the same team. you will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves. whatever the case, your marriage feels hard and heavy right now . you will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours. marriage is hard for everyone now and then. you will get therapy if you need to. you will fight, and then you will forgive. well, i can assure you that they have. and there will be hard times. but you will get through it. marriage is really fucking hard sometimes. marriage is not all heart-shaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop. everywhere you look, you see hap-hap-happy couples. there will be score-keeping. so fear not, you are not alone. you will be ok. there will be anger. and you find yourself singing coldplay lyrics on repeat. we all have. it will suck sometimes. you will compromise. no.

3 reasons why half of american workers are not using their vacation time even americans lucky enough to have paid time off are foregoing valuable vacation days to spend more time at the office, a national bankrate survey of 1,000 employees shows. the good news is that the top reason workers claimed they did not use all of their vacation days in 2016 was because they were saving them to use in 2017. about a quarter of workers say they simply work too much and can't afford to take time off, while just over 15 percent say they actively enjoy working and prefer it to vacation. "without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick — all of which have a direct impact on their work performance," says sarah berger, personal finance expert and "the cashlorette" at bankrate.com. but if you can't, and would still like a way to de-stress in your off hours, consider taking up a hobby. it's good to remember that more time on the job doesn't necessarily translate to better performance at the job. about a third of respondents said that they plan on taking advantage of the fact that their company lets them roll over unused days. some 52% of americans say they won't be using all of their paid time off this year. they're often leaving seven days or more on the table, especially in regions like the south and the midwest. so consider taking your vacation, even if you just recharge at home. the other reasons given confirm that many u.s. workers feel bound to their jobs. they may have said that last year too.) warren buffett plays the ukulele, and science says that has probably helped him make smart financial decisions. is america's culture of "workaholism" to blame? partly, the survey shows.

actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the s&p 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. however, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain. that 74 percent "win rate" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the s&p over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. in the last seven years in which the s&p 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them — 2007 — did the index drop in the fourth. six of the last seven times this happened, stocks rose after three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring? in these 19 years, the s&p's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a cnbc analysis of factset data. lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly — creating an additional bullish force in the market. the fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes. but for the bullish strategist tom lee of fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. the recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality — or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness. if history repeats, stocks could be in for a sweet end to the year. so will the fourth quarter, which begins on monday, continue the bullish trend? unfortunately, marshaling stats all day can obscure but can never alter the fact this question is patently unanswerable.
the seven simple money-saving hacks that could save you thousands a year saving money can often mean cutting back on things you love - but these expert tips prove that doesn't need to be the case. start a savings account   starting a savings account can fall down the list of priorities for many of us because the returns might not immediately be huge. here, femail rounds up the seven best tips...  buy clothes out of season   it might be hard to think of winter in spring, but planning ahead seasonally can help you save a bundle on clothes and shoes. the same goes for advocating for your favourite products and services on social media, as it's not unusual for them to get back to you to say thanks with some freebies. from stockpiling discounted goods to buying coats in summer, some of the handy hints focus on savvier shopping habits.others are as straightforward as asking big brands for a better deal. ask for discounts   it might sound too good to be true, but you would be surprised how often you can get a discount if you just ask. starting a savings account can fall down the list of priorities for many of us because the returns might not immediately be huge. if you can train yourself to think ahead to summer wear in the autumn, you'll see that the clearance sale prices can leave you with money in your pocket. stockpile when the price is right  if you see a good deal on something you'll use, it's often cost-effective to stockpile. money expert cathal wogan, from quidco, said: 'many of us want to be able to count our savings in pounds rather than pennies but don't know where to start. buying more will therefore increase your savings in the long term as you use your discounted purchases even when that item goes back to its standard price. a £100 winter coat could be down to £50 in spring as retailers clear stock, so thinking ahead to what you'll need in nine months time will reap major rewards. in-store offers can help you save on your weekly shop, but your receipts could help you save hundreds of pounds too. if you just send a letter to the freepost address of the manufacturer, they will often send you goodies or vouchers to say thank you. that's £104 of tinned tomatoes, so stockpiling those tins when they're available at half price could put £52 back into the family finances every year. this is especially true with big-name chains like phone shops, and homewares and electricals outlets, where flexible discounting can often be part of their retail policies. check for a cashback deal    on top of discounts, there is a cashback deal to be found on nearly everything we buy online. the surprisingly simple lifestyle hacks from quidco can help you save thousands of pounds a year without sacrificing your lifestyle. with smart shopping, those pounds can quickly add up to savings of thousands over the course of a year.' 'you can do this with non-perishable food goods, but also other items like cleaning and personal hygiene products, which are regularly heavily discounted. if you shop through quidco you can commonly get 5 per cent, 10 per cent or more in cashback on whatever you buy. it works by refunding the cost of certain goods after you upload a picture of your receipt, with dozens of different promotional offers every week. but very few people know how to get big cash bonuses when they start a savings account. don't be afraid to praise and complain  companies love when the people who enjoy their products tell them about it. 'there's no magic to it we've picked out some secrets to help people buy better. cathal explained: 'take for example a family using two £1 tins of tomatoes in a big weekly pasta dish. with average annual savings of £305, it's a money-saving habit worth picking up. apps such as clicksnap feature grocery discounts and even freebies. just make sure to do the maths.'
nbc ’s olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the u.s. team is doing at any given time, and sunday’s stellar swimming performances by katie ledecky and michael phelps — telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to american audiences — delivered a massive nielsen boost for nbc . early numbers show the network’s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since athens 2004 that a night three of the olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. what’s more, while viewership was still down compared to london, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both athens and sydney. it’s not all bad news: tens of millions of americans are still watching the olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by nielsen, and sunday’s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. 1 series, nbc ’s america’s got talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the london games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. viewership for the first three nights of the peacock’s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 london and 2008 beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. things didn’t improve much on saturday, the first night of competition: nbc averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from london’s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. perhaps some of that audience shifted to nbc ’s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network’s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won’t be of much comfort to peacock accountants. final numbers aren’t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like friday’s opening was down around 43 percent compared to london (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). critics and social media have savaged nbc ’s early coverage of the rio olympics — and the early ratings verdict from nielsen has not been any kinder. per nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with tv sets tuned to the olympics). if team usa can keep winning, nbc still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the games. worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of nbc ’s sunday night football last fall (12.9) rating. the first sign of trouble for nbc ’s rio ratings came saturday morning, when data for friday’s never-ending opening ceremony came in. but if the early pattern holds, rio will be the first summer olympics since sydney 2000 to score lower nielsen numbers than itspredecessor. while that’s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer’s no. still, expect nbc to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called "total audience" measurement data later this week. it’s also far too early to declare rio any sort of ratings disaster. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by nbc ’s non-stop commercial breaks. part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) photo: adam pretty critics and social media have predecessor. why rio ratings are terrible michael phelps.

poll shows what americans think of obama-rouhani phone call americans are more likely to approve than disapprove of president barack obama's recent phone call with the president of iran, but only a third think more open communications would improve relations between iran and the u.s., according to a new huffpost/yougov poll released thursday. the poll found that most still consider iran to be unfriendly to the united states, including 43 percent who said it is an enemy and 33 percent who said that it is unfriendly. the poll found that 48 percent of americans approve of obama speaking on the phone with iranian president hassan rouhani, while 31 percent said they disapprove (another 21 percent weren't sure). thirty-six percent of respondents said that the relationship would be improved by more communication, while 34 percent said that it would make no difference. but independents disapproved of obama's iran approach, 52 percent to 26 percent, while a plurality approved of the conversation with rouhani, 42 percent to 33 percent. the vast majority of democrats approved of both obama's approach to iran as a whole and of his phone call with rouhani, while the vast majority of republicans disapproved. and although more approved than disapproved of obama's phone conversation with rouhani, outlook on obama's handling of iran was more bleak. thirty-six percent said that they approved of obama's handling of issues with iran, while 46 percent said that they disapproved. the huffpost/yougov poll was conducted sept. 30-oct. 1 among 1,000 u.s. adults using a sample selected from yougov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult u.s. population. but respondents were skeptical that more open communications with iran would make much difference to the relationship between the two countries. obama's phone conversation with rouhani on sept. 27 was the first time since 1979 that leaders from the two countries had spoken. twenty-four percent of respondents said they had heard a lot, 48 percent that they had heard a little and 28 percent had heard nothing at all. still, that outlook reflected an improvement over a yougov poll conducted in mid-september, when 51 percent described iran as an enemy. a total of only 6 percent said that iran was either an ally or at least friendly to the united states. few said that they had heard much about the conversation between obama and rouhani. factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance. you can learn more about this project and take part in yougov's nationally representative opinion polling. the huffington post has teamed up with yougov to conduct daily opinion polls. another 10 percent said it would actually make things worse.
but those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk. this herb could be the secret to curbing cows’ climate-changing burps oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. but this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent. it might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast. danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. but while some americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. npr points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. we could just eat less dairy and beef. scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical.
why russia has two st. patrick’s days this year informally, russia has long marked st. patrick's day, joining the rest of the world in the march 17 celebration of irish culture that includes lots of green and lots of drinking. orthodox leaders told the russian media they hoped that recognizing saint patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of christianity, before the schism of 1054 that divided the faith into east and west. despite this, the divide between the two wings of christianity means that the russian orthodox church will not celebrate st. patrick's day along with the rest of the world. this means that the day of st. patrick's death — march 17 in the gregorian calendar — falls on march 30 for the russian orthodox church. for members of the orthodox faith, celebrating two st. patrick's days may not be an option: march 17 falls in the middle of the orthodox observance of lent, when many religious russians abstain from alcohol. "i am very happy that our st. patrick’s day falls on a different date, that way the traditions associated with it, that are strictly cultural and not religious can be ignored," fomin said. more than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in moscow, which will take place on march 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to ireland that take place march 15 to 26. earlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of saint patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of ireland. "we hope to see our friends in moscow on all of our irish events in the next two weeks," said arthur hendrick, consul at the irish embassy in moscow. father igor fomin, head of a church at the moscow state institute of international relations, told tass news agency that getting drunk in honor of a saint is like being heavily intoxicated at your mother’s gravesite. while the catholic church adopted the gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the russian orthodox church still uses the older julian calendar. in a statement given to the govorit moskva radio station, the irish government said it was glad the russian orthodox church had made the decision. it's formally celebrating st. patrick's day for the first time — but on march 30. the march 30 date seems likely to extend russia's st. patrick's day festivities rather than replace them. russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. this year, however, the russian orthodox church is doing something different. the two calendars are about two weeks out of sync.

probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, brock has a lot at stake so he’s

investigations defines rape differently, as "penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim". although i can’t save every boat, i hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. in it, i read and learned for the first time about how i was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that i was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign

vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. i also encourage the african union to make public and act upon the report of its commission of inquiry on south sudan 11/19 sudan (darfur) recommendation: i call upon the government of the sudan to grant the united nations and its humanitarian partners unfettered access for monitoring and the provision of assistance to people in need in darfur. i was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. instead, i was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. why brock turner is not actually a rapist there has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to american student there has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to american student brock turner , following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. you were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. that’s when i learned i had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but i was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. i can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because i have nightmares of being touched where i cannot wake up, i did this thing where i waited until the sun came up and i felt safe enough to sleep. instead of taking time to heal, i was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. the night the news came out i sat my parents down and told them that i had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that i’m okay, i’m right here, and i’m okay. you said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to "speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that." she did not know that beneath my sweats, i had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and i felt too empty to continue to speak. i fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions i had about the legal system. i encourage the adoption of a sexual offences bill as a matter of priority 10/19 south sudan recommendation: i urge the parties to the conflict in south sudan to adopt action plans to implement the commitments made under their respective communiqués. as such, the case continued on the basis of ‘lesser’ charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. then, i decided it was my only night with her, i had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, i would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. the night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. it is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. the probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain i have been forced to endure. we can let this destroy us, i can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, i accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. while you worry about your shattered reputation, i refrigerated spoons every night so when i woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, i would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that i could see. i also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. on that morning, all that i was told was that i had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that i should get retested for hiv because results don’t always show up immediately. they gave me huge hugs, and then i walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes. the fact that brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class. we have – for the most part – moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of ‘phallo-centric’ rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed. he pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice. to sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes i wanted it, yes i permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. he didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we "met", i’m not sure i would go so far as to say that. everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. that i am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the all-american swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. my family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. brock turner’s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined – and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing – out into the open. i tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy i didn’t talk, i didn’t eat, i didn’t sleep, i didn’t interact with anyone. i was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, i may have been raped behind a dumpster, but i don’t know by who or when or how. it is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. my boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, "i was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?" instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. that reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. to listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that i had this coming for me. you were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. it is the saddest type of confusion to be told i was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. my life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices i had endured. a compelling, haunting description by the victim of her experience has been read millions of times online after being released by the district attorney – its power so at odds with the court’s apparent leniency. i used to pride myself on my independence, now i am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where i should be comfortable being. right now your name is tainted, so i challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. every time a new article [would] come out, i lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. i fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. i didn’t talk, i didn’t eat, i didn’t sleep, i didn’t interact with anyone, and i became isolated from the ones i loved most. to say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. i encourage the authorities to implement law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. i call upon the government of south sudan to address the negative impact of customary law on women’s rights and to reflect international human rights standards in national law. the capacity of the united nations system should be enhanced through the deployment of women’s protection advisers or equivalent specialists 6/19 libya recommendation: i urge the national authorities in libya to implement decree no. the world is huge, it is so much bigger than palo alto and stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. when i was finally allowed to use the restroom, i pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. if a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? read the stanford victim's full impact statement your honor, if it is all right, for the majority of this statement i would like to address the defendant directly. the consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. i have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. you said, if i wanted to get to know her, i should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room. had brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, i would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. if she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. and i thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. the probation officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. the way i have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if i’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. if i told them, i would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead i pretended the whole thing wasn’t real. i’m good at cooking, put that in there, i think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened. i thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. it stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way i carry myself, the way i live the rest of my life. even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; i only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. by definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction. and then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. i smiled at her, i told her to look at me, i’m right here, i’m okay, everything’s okay, i’m right here. i hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. it shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. i was not only told that i was assaulted, i was told that because i couldn’t remember, i technically could not prove it was unwanted. the seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. i shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, i left a little pile in every room i sat in. when the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. i don’t see headlines that read, brock turner, guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. but alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. programmes to support the social reintegration of women and girls released from captivity by isil are urgently needed, as is community-based medical and psychological care. at the bottom of the article, after i learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. i also told the probation officer that what i truly wanted was for brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing. conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. sexual violence should be an element in all ceasefire and peace negotiations, excluded from the scope of amnesty provisions and addressed in transitional justice processes. that’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year. to listen to him say i sounded drunk on the phone because i’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. the sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here i was at the trial, answering question like: how old are you? if her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her. to point out that in the voicemail, i said i would reward my boyfriend and we all know what i was thinking. i was terrified of it, i didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. as in california, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. i want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. i fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others. if she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. we were both drunk, the difference is i did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my da to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me. i planned to stay at home by myself, watch some tv and read, while she went to a party with her friends. just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. you say that, but i want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. i argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying swedish grad students. here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when i was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. i am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if i was worth something. unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, i am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. worst of all, i was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. the only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer. it is embarrassing how feeble i feel, how timidly i move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry. i had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation. i don’t sleep when i think about the way it could have gone if the swedes had never come. if you think i was spared, came out unscathed, that today i ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. he admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups. that is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime. for one week after the incident, i didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. in the next paragraph, i read something that i will never forgive; i read that according to him, i liked it. secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. since that did not occur turner is a criminal, a sex offender – but he isn’t, according to the law, a rapist. when i was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, i said, i can’t prepare for that. even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism. you said, i stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. his guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that i became unconscious, that is never what this was about. also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. the three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. my testimony was weak, was incomplete, and i was made to believe that perhaps, i am not enough to win this. future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. the tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman. your attorney’s closing statement began, "my sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister." when i read the probation officer’s report, i was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. the thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. if i had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? you don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today. to have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something i will never forget. we have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. i stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, i don’t want my body anymore. i want to know, if those evil swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. i learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. see one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. i made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college. peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. i had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. my dad made some dinner and i sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. and that’s quite accurate – he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? my clothes were confiscated and i stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. you took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. if you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and i will die, i’m almost there. then, i felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. that’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. when the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. you have no idea how hard i have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. california is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise ‘object penetration’ to a lesser degree than penile penetration. my own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, i would slap him. let me rephrase for you, i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. you realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? i wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else. i didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. his attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is brock, because she doesn’t remember. you have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. would you then go find a friend and say, will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? i was asked to sign papers that said "rape victim" and i thought something has really happened. i have lost weight from stress, when people would comment i told them i’ve been running a lot lately. i had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions. when the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. the night after it happened, he said he thought i liked it because i rubbed his back. most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who i have yet to meet. he got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. i was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. one day, i was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. this was how i learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. one year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so. and you’re right, maybe i was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. i will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them. on the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. i sleep with two bicycles that i drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. really because on page 53 i’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that i admit to, but it is not criminal. lastly you said, i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life. two guys on bikes noticed i wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. you have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. when you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. even so, turner’s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. that he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused. but halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because i could no longer stand up. that night i had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. if he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. i have to relearn that i am not fragile, i am capable, i am wholesome, not just livid and weak. it is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. this is everything i had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. it is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. according to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because i fell down. this was a game of strategy, as if i could be tricked out of my own worth. you said, being drunk i just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she. but i don’t remember, so how do i prove i didn’t like it. at the of end of the hearing, the trial, i was too tired to speak. everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you." a year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. if at any time i thought she was not responding, i would have stopped immediately." i am asking you; would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? i would go home turn off my phone and for days i would not speak. even if you did know me, i would not want [to] be in this situation. in order to keep breathing, i thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence. when i read about me like this, i said, this can’t be me. that it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. what has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? how fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me. i was slurring, too drunk to consent way before i was on the ground. the point is, this is everything my family and i endured during the trial. he’d asked if i wanted to go to his dorm, i said yes. she was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. i used my savings to go as far away as i could possibly be. i thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. my hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. you said, during the trial i didn’t want to victimize her at all. i hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person. the idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. i told the probation officer i do not want brock to rot away in prison. goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. throughout incarceration i hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. i assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me. in newspapers my name was "unconscious intoxicated woman", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. you think that’s what i’ve spent the past year fighting for? he had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. the probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. but in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. i called myself "big mama", because i knew i’d be the oldest one there. brock stated, "at no time did i see that she was not responding. you cannot give me back the life i had before that night either. around the world outraged headlines have referred to the "brock turner rape case". my sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. if you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an aa meeting. sometimes i think, if i hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. for three months, i went to bed at six o’clock in the morning. brock had yet to issue a statement, and i had not read his remarks. i still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. i thought maybe i had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. all the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, i can take it. but for now, i should go home and get back to my normal life. in my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a q and a. but those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of dna testing. he’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. the probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. as this is a first offense i can see where leniency would beckon. to calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. my statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. the next thing i remember i was in a gurney in a hallway. you knocked down both our towers, i collapsed at the same time you did. no one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. i still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. what do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? i believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. he said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. that was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case. i had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. i was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. then he asked if he could finger me and i said yes. i don’t care if you know their phone number or not. look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, i look like a p.e. i could not imagine my family having to read about this online. i would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. this is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. no matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense. he can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. that day we drove home and for hours my sister held me. i did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. you do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. when you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. you do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. i’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. but then i realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub. maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. i request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. he is young, but he is old enough to know better. drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. i had no power, i had no voice, i was defenseless. for a while, i believed that that was all i was. show men how to respect women, not how to drink less. i had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? when people doubt you or dismiss you, i am with you. i wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? my independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle i had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? you do not get to not know why you ran. instead of his attorney saying, did you notice any abrasions? that i was also afraid, that i was also devastated. you have a brain and a voice and a heart. it took me eight months to even talk about what happened. to relearn that this is not all that i am. i could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct. imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. i should have never been touched in the first place. in essence, californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis. i mean you had just asked for my consent, right? he said he had asked if i wanted to dance. on nights when you feel alone, i am with you. how did you not notice while on top of me? i was very calm and wondering where my sister was. he said you had an erection, because it was cold. under english law, turner wouldn’t be classified as a rapist either. throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. to listen to him use my own sister against me. regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. there are times i did not want to be touched. when they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, "stop! someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. my sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. you bought me a ticket to a planet where i lived by myself. i could not digest or accept any of this information. note; if a girl falls help her get back up. instinctively and immediately, i wanted to take away her pain. you didn’t even stop when i was unconscious anyway! ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. my damage was internal, unseen, i carry it with me. you made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be. yours will hold you and you will go on. my brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. you never let me forget what happened to me. most guys don’t ask, can i finger you? i still don’t have words for that feeling. after work, i would drive to a secluded place to scream. he admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. and finally, to girls everywhere, i am with you. by the way, he’s really good at swimming. again, i do not have words for these feelings. you tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense. on january 17th, 2015, it was a quiet saturday night at home. because my gut was saying, help me, help me. was your phone on silent when your sister called? he said, you didn’t notice any abrasions, right? you tried to use my own sister against me. mine has held me up through all of this. the damage is done, no one can undo it. on the way there, i joked that undergrad guys would have braces. everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. you ran because you said you felt scared. next in the story, two people approached you. again, he asked me, "what happened last night? that we are looking out for one another. what’d you do when you got there? that’s what we’re speaking out against? if she can’t do that, then no. that alone can pull you out of anything. i have never been penetrated after three words. you are the cause, i am the effect. you should have never done this to me. he was guilty the minute i woke up. no girl wants to be in this situation. do you remember what time you woke up? okay, we’ll let brock fill it in. do you remember any more from that night? that’s all i’m going to say. you said, you would have stopped and gotten help. your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. but you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. after a few hours of this, they let me shower. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. and that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. and then it came time for him to testify. a deputy explained i had been assaulted. i said yes, and hung up to cry. i don’t even know this person. i looked down and there was nothing. i still don’t know this person. i knew no one at this party. you were caught red handed, with no explanation. to girls everywhere, i am with you. who dropped you off at this party? then he learned i could not remember. if a girl falls help her up. somehow, you still don’t get it. how many times did you black out? you said you were a party animal? again, you were not wrong for drinking. but what time did you do that? where does promiscuity even come into play? why were you going to this party? so never stop fighting, i believe you. to conclude, i want to say thank you. well what did you have for dinner? so one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. i became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. and now we both have a choice. what would have happened to me? why am i still explaining this. with whom did you urinate outside? are you serious with your boyfriend? it is enough to be suffering. tucked my bra back into my dress? do you have a history of cheating? speak out against campus drinking culture. untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? don’t touch her, just no. did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? you couldn’t even do that. i am no stranger to suffering. what container did you drink out of? did you make it home okay?" what did you eat that day? how much do you usually drink? are you sure you did that? your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. my memory loss would be used against me. now to address the sentencing. i want to say this. the isolation at times was unbearable. this is common sense, human decency. you made me a victim. i have done enough explaining. then i read your statement. has he been seeing a psychologist? it doesn’t make sense. somehow, you still sound confused. alcohol is not an excuse. he’s in the clear. you do not touch her. the context is also important. this can’t be me. but apparently i granted full permission. did you drink with dinner? what does this text mean? do you remember silencing it? did you drink in college? did you party at frats? who gave you the drink? are you sexually active with him? how much did you drink? were you wearing your cardigan? when did you start dating? what color was your cardigan? how much do you weigh? this is where i became revictimized. you possess immense love from your family. he is a lifetime sex registrant. who were you texting? just one coherent string of words. i was not okay. what were you wearing? that doesn’t expire. there’s your first powerpoint slide. but here we are. that’s so damaging. when did you drink? sipping fireball is not your crime. no, not even water? when did you urinate? i have no words. where did you urinate? you are very close. apparently i said yes. that’s the difference. not maybe, just no. where was the confusion? someone else stopped you. is it a factor? would you ever cheat? i fought everyday for you. closed my legs, covered me? i would leave drained, silent. assault is not an accident. but where exactly? it felt serious. campus drinking culture. i was awake, right? you and me. who made dinner? a back rub. campus [sexual] assault. i was wrong. you are guilty. i liked it. at what time? the truth won, the truth spoke for itself. down with skyy vodka. down with jack daniels. that helplessness was traumatizing. use them wisely. i kept reading. i was horrified. nobody wins. thank you. no? yes. nobody. absolutely.
this is the secret to the insane blt at tom colicchio's new sandwich shop when top chef judge and restaurateur tom colicchio and his business partner sisha ortuzar opened 'wichcraft 13 years ago, they had no idea it would become as enormous a success as it has—or that its ingenious, flavor-packed sandwiches would become synonymous with "lunch" for so many busy new yorkers. for the aioli: 1 large egg yolk, preferably from a pasture-raised egg 1⁄2 teaspoon dijon mustard 1⁄2 teaspoon chopped garlic pinch of cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 cup grapeseed oil 1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt freshly ground black pepper place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. 1 pound thick-cut bacon 4 large leaves of bibb lettuce 8 slices country bread 4 tablespoons aioli (see recipe below) sea salt and freshly ground black pepper for the blt: in a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain—which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in grand central this fall—thanks to colicchio and ortuzar's knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in nyc. 'wichcraft blt recipe: makes 4 sandwiches 1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1⁄2-inch thick (tip: sit the tomato stem side down on the counter and using a very sharp knife, slice it horizontally to prevent the juices from running out.) back then, colicchio and his team already had hits on their hands with craft and craftbar—both groundbreaking farm-to-table restaurants when they first opened in manhattan —and 'wichcraft was just meant to be a little sandwich shop spinoff. ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at craft, "was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let’s do a sandwich restaurant. the tweaking and rebranding of 'wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and colicchio said he's hoping to expand 'wichcraft to other cities in the near future. place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don’t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. in new york, that's typically august until early september, and that's the only time you'll find this blt on 'wichcraft's menu. if you're like us, you'll be whipping up this sandwich multiple times a week, all the way through tomato season. now, with its brand-new location in tribeca, colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out "much faster." but for anyone trying the recipe at home, there's one crucial secret to making the sandwich come out perfectly, colicchio says. place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. the blt is available starting august 1 at the new tribeca location and all the 'wichcraft shops. in the meantime, anyone who won't be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try blt recipe, which perfects the classic american sandwich. "if you’re gonna make a blt, you have to have great tomatoes, in season and fresh. then slowly add the remaining grapeseed oil and blend until you have a smooth aioli. after the season is over, it's not just the tomatoes that'll be gone. its sandwiches, like the phenomenal blt, will take an average of "five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes," colicchio said. evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. still, as colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. close the sandwiches with the remaining four bread slices, toasted side down. start the blender and slowly add the grapeseed oi in a thin, even stream. (the sandwich shops use eckerton hill farms tomatoes from the union square greenmarket, along with berkshire bacon.) place the bacon over the tomatoes, followed by the lettuce. season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. when half of the oil has been added, add 1 tablespoon water. toast the bread on one side only. use immediately or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. and that’s how 'wichcraft was born," colicchio told the feast. season with the salt and pepper. tom colicchio (right) with sisha ortuzar. otherwise don’t make it." carefully cut into halves and serve. the sandwich will vanish too.

the interesting thing that happened when kansas cut taxes and california hiked them presidential candidate bernie sanders poses for a photograph with workers as he stops to eat at an in-n-out burger after a rally on june 3, 2016, in pinole, calif. (photo by matt mcclain/the washington post) in 2012, voters in california approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. [bernie sanders is right: the top 0.1 percent have as much as the bottom 90 percent] kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said menzie chinn, an economist at the university of wisconsin-madison, who has been following kansas’s economy. the poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the institute on taxation and economic policy in washington. on the whole, brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich. california's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the bureau of economic analysis, tying it with oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. also that year, the governor of kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. but the divergent experiences of california and kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it. that was up from 3.1 percent growth for the golden state in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack. for the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less. not right away -- california grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week. that's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as nebraska (2.1 percent) and missouri (1.2 percent). meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000. standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service have signaled that they could reduce kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills. while state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. the recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as los angeles, san jose and san francisco. the state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax. [kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor] other effects of the kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented. the state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average. the kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. still, the noncoastal regions of california lag far behind silicon valley and los angeles in their job and growth recoveries. or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be kansas. the damage from california's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the central valley. but almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. by a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession. kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all californians. conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand. it is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that california has powered along. [will higher taxes on the rich derail california’s economic comeback?] sam brownback (r) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. "it’s remarkable," chinn said. conservative economists predicted a boom. neither of those predictions came true. the shortfalls have forced gov.
(photo: kvue) austin - an austin couple who stopped to pick up a meal at an ihop restaurant early monday said they will never go to another ihop after the message they saw on their receipt. arainia brown and her boyfriend rolman sparkman were traveling back to austin and decided to grab a to-go order from the ihop at i-35 and cesar chavez around 3 a.m. monday. ihop corporate released the following statement about the incident: "this was a poor choice made by our franchisee’s team member, and is not in keeping with policies and procedures. brown and sparkman said they hope the server understands the gravity of typing those two words and the example it set to his co-workers. everyone is welcome in our restaurants and our franchisee is using this as a teachable moment for the entire team so that it will not reoccur." brown said she didn't want to cause any commotion, especially before receiving her food, so rather than say something to the server or manager about the receipt, she put something on facebook. "why would you do that to your own peoples," said sparkman, "when you already know what's been going on in the past?" brown and sparkmen were shocked to see "black ppl" typed at the top of their receipt. kvue news reached out to acg texas restaurants and were told they did not have a comment. "franchisee" refers to acg texas restaurants, a group that owns and operates 67 restaurants across texas. adding insult to injury, brown said the server was a young black man. "it's very serious and it hurt a lot of people's feelings." austin couple upset with description on ihop receipt ihop receipt. by monday evening, a picture of her receipt has been shared more than 14,000 times. "at the end of the day, everybody is a human being. when brown saw her receipt, she immediately became upset. "don't put, don't label me. "you could have asked me my name," said brown. everybody is trying to work and make a living. "this is not a joke," said sparkman. i don't label you." "i feel upset, i'm sad, i'm angry. we recognize that it could be offensive and apologize. two words that induced a range of emotions. like this, it makes no sense," said brown. copyright 2016 kvue copyright 2016 kvue copyright 2016 kvue everybody is the same," added brown.
well this is awkward (photos) conventional wisdom says that when you attend a designer's runway show during fashion week, you're supposed to wear an outfit by that designer. that's not out of the ordinary, per se... but what was pretty weird was how many women we spotted wearing the exact same outfit. more women than we can count on one hand wore looks from the designer's fall 2013 collection. we can see why -- these outfits are pretty darn adorable. out of a 52-look collection, two patterns positively exploded. well, tuesday's marc by marc jacobs' showgoers did exactly that. it's a way to prove your allegiance and to represent the brand. see for yourself in the photos below!

ruben guerrero, the husband of montebello mayor christina cortez, was arrested thursday morning by los angeles county sheriff's deputies on suspicion of sales of methamphetamine and sale of narcotics near a school. apparently, guerrero has a bit of a history, as the los angeles times reports: in november 1999, he was convicted of driving under the influence. cortez said the vehicle damaged in the early-morning fire on sept. 28, 2012, was driven mostly by her husband, the whittier daily news reported. this year, montebello councilman frank gomez sought a restraining order against guerrero, saying the mayor's husband had made threats -- once through voicemail and once at a council meeting. mayor cortez was at home with their children when deputies served her with a search warrant, webpronews reports. mayor's husband busted for allegedly selling meth a southern california mayor's husband has been arrested for allegedly selling meth. last year, arson investigators with the montebello fire department investigated a "suspicious" fire that burned cortez's chevrolet suburban. "as an elected official, as a mother and daughter, i have stood behind the education of knowing the dangers of drugs. authorities believe guerrero was using his house as a base of operation to deal meth. "of course i am very disappointed and like everyone else, shocked," mayor cortez said, nbc reports. authorites also searched cortez’s 89-year-old grandmother's house. guerrero posted $60,000 bail by thursday evening and was released from jail. the restraining order was denied in january, court records show. he was the only suspect implicated. today's events will not change that."
you won’t believe the food that has quickly replaced tobacco as the most popular currency in us prisons ramen is one of the most popular foods in the country- it’s been having a major moment for years now. according to a study done by michael gibson-light, a doctoral candidate at the university of arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to us prisoners have made the food a commodity. at the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. he attributes ramen’s popularity to the fact that it’s "easy to get" and "high in calories," something of value to people who "spend their days working and exercising." it includes recipes that can be made with items available to prisoners, such as tamales "doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen," and celebrity ramen recipes. "[money] doesn’t change unless there’s some drastic change to the value in people using it," gibson-light said. now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in us prisons, the guardian reports. gustavo "goose" alvarez who spent more than ten years in prison wrote a book about it called prison ramen: recipes and stories from behind bars. when something is valuable and being traded on a sort of black market, things can get tricky. the change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. and the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they’re worth. a sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen.

"people get killed over soup." every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. they need the energy.
a member of the x-men just came out of the closet marvel entertainment made a bold move this week when a new character in the "uncanny x-men" series came out of the closet in a new installment of the comic books. the marvel comics app enables same-day digital downloads of marvel comics, and marvel unlimited is a member subscription service that gives members unlimited access to over 13,000 issues of marvel's classic and newer titles. "the fact that ben has come out as homosexual is just a small facet of who he is and what he is going to bring to cyclops’ select team of x-men." "continuing with marvel’s rich tradition of character development and storytelling, this shape-shifting mutant can alter his appearance to mimic anyone he is in close proximity with," joe taraborrelli, sr. communications manager of marvel entertainment told the huffington post. the entire marvel universe is now available in digital format through the marvel comics app and the marvel comics unlimited app. benjamin deeds, one of the most recent mutants to be discovered in the series, revealed his sexual orientation in "uncanny x-men #14," written by brian michael bendis, slated for release this week. this isn't the first time a comic book character has come out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (lgbt). from kevin keller to buffy to batwoman, comic book culture has a long history of lgbt inclusivity and positive representation.

"it couldn't be, like, my father's brother's sister's shoe repair guy heard once that, you know. so the outlandish physical, sexual things that happened -- they really did happen." or at least, were based on real stories. turns out, they were real!

a review of census bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. to identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 wall st. reviewed state data on income from the u.s. census bureau’s 2012 american community survey (acs). and the richest state in the country is... from 24/7 wall st. last year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the u.s. census bureau. according to the bureau of labor statistics, while 8.1% of american workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. in many of the highest-income states, like new hampshire, minnesota and hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%. the high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed. we also reviewed unemployment data provided by the bureau of labor statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 acs data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty. elise gould, director of health policy for economic policy institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. all of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. at the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions. states with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. in 2012, maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. in some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. while the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. "the big story is that everything was stagnant over the year" said economic policy institute’s elise gould. "we have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. this is despite the fact that the u.s. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012. mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of maryland’s. based on census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. while 15.9% of americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four mississippians did. "when we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. here are america's richest states, according to 24/7 wall st. sheldon danziger, president of the russell sage foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. i don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor." unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. "we’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place." "even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change." gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story. the types of jobs available in each state also affect income. "there’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers," danziger said. this was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008. employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. so it’s about jobs."
-walt disney, neal gabler because disney's job -- storytelling and managing a company -- involved constantly refocusing the brain, and because he was something of a perfectionist, being aimless for a period of time meant he happily stopped caring about work -- and gained the power to continue forging onward. because disney's job -- storytelling and managing a company -- involved constantly refocusing the brain, and because he was something of a perfectionist, being aimless for a period of time meant he happily stopped caring about work -- and gained the power to continue forging onward. when disney was emotionally broken down by the business of entertainment, upon insistence by his brother and colleagues, he reluctantly went on vacation despite all his problems at the studio: walt said that he and lillian had the "time of our life" because he had reached the point where "i didn't give a darn." i've tried numerous techniques to counter this challenge: coffee (especially when mcdonald's was giving away free smalls) splashing cold water on my face wandering around online snacking yet i've found one technique to be the most effective: going for a walk. on days i don't take it, i feel like i'm doing my employer or client an injustice -- because i can't give them my brain's full output that they deserve. not because i don't like what i'm doing, but because my brain is just fried and i'm hitting the afternoon hump. this might be the most energizing afternoon routine (it's not more coffee) every day at around 3 p.m., my brain gets weary. even recently, when the temperature dropped down to -30 celsius, i bundled up and wandered outside -- and into toronto's underground tunnel system. the longest stroll i've taken is around 10 minutes, and i just wander around the block. i recently read neal gabler's biography of walt disney. i pass by the open hotel lobby that's air-conditioned in the summer and heated in the winter. he felt he had been liberated from the burden of his own perfectionism. by the students on their way to and from art school. i've even run into friends around the block. by storeowners, by late lunchers, by buildings under construction and their builders, by many things. i look forward to this break every day.
boy dies after playing new 'game' all the kids are playing a little boy is dead and a family is heartbroken due to a terrifying game. known as 'the choking game,' kids are challenging each other to try and cut off their own airway to experience euphoria. garrett pope, sr. spoke to the principal of his late son's school to warn staff to be aware. they want parents to talk to their kids about these kinds of stunts and challenges that can be so dangerous. garrett pope, an 11-year-old sixth-grader from indian land, accidentally killed himself in an attempt to play the game. his family feel obligated to get garrett's story out there to warn others. they're not sure of where garrett jr. heard about the game. there's no history of it in their internet searches. no foul play is suspected, nor do authorities believe the young man deliberately took his life. an investigation ruled garret's death an accident in a game gone wrong. the game involved cutting off his airway. his family says 'he just took this 'game' too far.' "people need to know about this," said mr. pope. "it’s not a 'game.' unfortunately, not all kids survive it. we need to speak up." it's senseless.
everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the red sea when you walk into the room. but you don’t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions. but you don’t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not. i was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what i’m playing—but i wasn’t in love with the process. if you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. and you say something like, "i want to be happy and have a great family and a job i like," it’s so ubiquitous that it doesn’t even mean anything. everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship—but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we’re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings. everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence—but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blasé confines of an infinite cubicle hell. but you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. any badass guitar song i heard, i would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. the daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit. but even then it was never a question of if i’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. and it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: i didn’t actually want it. a more interesting question, a question that perhaps you’ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? the quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. i was biding my time before i could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. people who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it. but the truth is far less interesting than that: i thought i wanted something, but it turns out i didn’t. and what it took me a long time to discover is that i didn’t like to climb much. if you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand. the entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that i chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. but i ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. there’s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, "you’ve just got to want it enough!" people who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. self-help would say that i either wasn’t courageous enough, determined enough or i didn’t believe in myself enough. and when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, "what was that for?" and to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life. people who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. our culture would tell me that i’ve somehow failed myself, that i’m a quitter or a loser. they just aren’t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want "enough." if you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. you can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life. maybe what you want isn’t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. for most of my adolescence and young adulthood, i fantasized about being a musician — a rock star, in particular. the fantasizing continued up through college, even after i dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. what determines your success isn’t "what do you want to enjoy?" this is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. it’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. hell, i didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it. if i ask you, "what do you want out of life?" at the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. i’d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something. people want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth. it’s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. i was in love not with the fight but only the victory. the question is, "what pain do you want to sustain?" everyone would like that—it’s easy to like that. for years and years and until the question morphs from "what if?" it’s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together. maybe you don’t actually want it at all. here’s a way better question everybody wants what feels good. the broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for? sometimes i ask people, "how do you choose to suffer?" these people tilt their heads and look at me like i have twelve noses. what is the pain that you want to sustain? despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. it’s what makes me me and you you. people want to start their own business or become financially independent. and because of that, i failed at it. i wanted the result and not the process. you probably know to ask yourself, "what do i want?" and ultimately that’s the hard question that matters. and pretty much all of us have similar answers. the positive is the side effect of handling the negative. it’s the question that can change your life. this fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. you can’t win if you don’t play. you can’t have a pain-free life. it’s part of the game of love. this is not another admonishment of "no pain, no gain." i wanted the reward and not the struggle. then, i needed to find the time. and life doesn’t work that way. the more interesting question is the pain. what are you willing to struggle for? it can’t all be roses and unicorns. positive experience is easy to handle. i just liked to imagine the top. that answer will actually get you somewhere. because you have to choose something. then, i needed to make money. this is not a call for willpower or "grit." and everybody wants something enough. so choose your struggles wisely, my friend. they settle and wonder "what if?" people want an amazing physique. pleasure is an easy question. into "was that it?" then ... and then nothing. and so they settle. people want a partner, a spouse. first, i needed to finish school. i hardly tried at all. everybody wants something. because happiness requires struggle. end of story. this post originally appeared on markmanson.net. follow @iammarkmanson on twitter. repeatedly.

andy garcia is playing the mayor of new york city, michael k. williams is a character named hawkins, matt walsh is a character named rourke (i could easily see him working for the mayor), chris hemsworth is the new secretary for the ghostbusters, and saturday night live writer neil casey is the film’s villain. https://t.co/msqvo5isti — paul feig (@paulfeig) july 18, 2015 unfortunately, he didn’t match the names with each actress, but thanks to set photos that have glimpses of the nametags on each of the jumpsuits, fans have been able to determine who is playing who very quickly. we’ve already seen the new proton packs (with added specs to help cosplayers), the new ecto-1, and a shot of melissa mccarthy, kristen wiig, kate mckinnon and leslie jones all suited up and ready to bust ghosts. melissa mccarthy is abby yates, kristen wiig is erin gilbert, kate mckinnon is jillian holtzmann and leslie jones is patty tolan. paul feig reveals character names for the new 'ghostbusters' director paul feig has been revealing quite a bit from his forthcoming ghostbusters reboot that’s currently shooting in new york city. honestly, as someone who is a massive ghostbusters fan (i have an entire wall with action figures and original artwork), this is something that i’m not very worried about anymore. and let’s not forget that dan ayrkoyd also confirmed that he’ll have a cameo in the film in a scene with kristen wiig. some fans have been trying to match up the new characters with the original ghostbusters, peter venkman (bill murray), ray stantz (dan aykroyd), egon spenger (harold ramis) and winston zeddemore (ernie hudson). as with any reboot or remake, a new take on the material won’t take away from how much i love the original movies. however, we have to keep in mind that this is a ghostbusters reboot, and not a straight-up remake. that changed yesterday when feig replied to a request to reveal the character names on twitter from a ghostsbusters fan and charity organization. as for the supporting cast, we already know some details about their characters. but we still didn’t know what characters the ladies were playing. furthermore, after finally seeing how surprisingly good and funny spy was earlier this summer, i think feig can pull this off. erin gilbert, jillian holtzmann, abby yates and patty tolan. so these characters won’t have the exactsame traits as the original team. find out the new ghostbusters character names after the jump! ghostbusters arrives next summer on july 22nd, 2016. here’s what feig wrote on twitter: okay, here you go. now you know even more.
it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise then, that a newer study has revealed such body image issues are spurring millions of men to hit the gym — even though many would probably never admit it. the study says these men are motivated by "feelings of guilt and shame rather than a desire to build muscle," which may come as a surprise to many — even men who may not be willing to admit it to themselves. according to a recent study published in psychology of men & masculinity, as many as 20% to 40% of american men are struggling with body image problems in some shape or form. specifically, it’s "men’s hidden fears about body fat" that are driving gym attendance, according to a team of researchers from the university of lincoln (u.k.) and australia’s curtin university. some men even go to experience a place of solace; somewhere outside of the house and away from work where they can relax, hit the steam room, or just burn off some calories on the treadmill. the secret reason so many men go to the gym for millions of men, going to the gym is a daily ritual. body image issues aren’t typically associated with men, though they are fairly widespread. but new research indicates there are actually body image issues at play driving more men to fitness centers than you might expect. their reasons may vary widely — from looking to lose weight to building muscle and getting chiseled.
you'll never believe how this woman won $1 million in just 8 seconds typically, a person’s quest for a seven-figure income or net worth by the time they retire comes with plenty of steps. they either have to save, learn to invest like the pros, own some serious property, start a business, or come up with a unbelievable million-dollar idea. for the average person, making a million bucks isn’t easy. but for this woman who appeared on the price is right, winning only took eight seconds. after making an incredibly lucky first guess while playing the clock game, cynthia is literally floored after realizing she’ll be taking home more than just an exercise machine and a couch. reality doesn’t even set in for her until the confetti begins falling from the ceiling.

justin bieber seems to have changed his name, at least on instagram, and has acknowledged the change on twitter -- where he retweeted a couple of fans who've announced it. update feb. 12 -- a true teenager, it seems like bieber has changed his mind and is back to being called justin bieber now on instagram. other bizzles include a miami rapper who was shot and killed in october 2012; a christian rapper from houston who recently made headlines for recording an anti-gay version of macklemore's "same love"; and a u.k. rapper, lethal bizzle, who seems less than pleased with the canadian singer's new moniker. the daily mail notes that the switch took place saturday (feb. 8), following a series of photos bieber -- err bizzle -- posted in which he poses with famous rappers diddy, rick ross and ti. @justinbieber goes by a different name now beliebers, say hello to your new master: bizzle. bieber isn't the first to sport the name. oh well.
"i don’t think of willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 dandy’s sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric — where there’s no telling what he’ll do or where he ever found his get-up — except that it strangely fits him: part of this world, part of another," he wrote, adding, "a vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste. as i walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones i’m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but i keep on walking, until i realize that i no longer have my cane. gene wilder agreed to play willy wonka under this one condition "willy wonka & the chocolate factory" is one of those movies that transcends time. when asked why he wanted to do this, wilder simply said, "because from that time on, no one will know if i’m lying or telling the truth." i’d like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. the scene featuring wonka’s grand entrance is one of the most memorable in the film, thanks to wilder’s imagination and creativity. according to letters of note, the actor wrote a letter to stuart offering up some suggestions for the character’s signature look. the original film, released in 1971 and directed by mel stuart, starred the late screen icon gene wilder as the titular willy wonka. i start to fall forward, and just before i hit the ground, i do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause." as reported by letters of note, wilder told stuart: "when i make my first entrance. after the crowd sees willy wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. wilder wanted wonka to be completely unpredictable, and as we all know, he got his wish. wilder died at the age of 83 on sunday, due to complications from alzheimer’s disease at his home in stamford, connecticut. in fact, he only agreed to play the famous candyman under one condition. without wilder the film may have been good, but with him, it was wonderful. as it turns out, however, the actor wasn’t always sold on the role. wilder also provided some input about wonka’s costume after seeing the first sketches. something mysterious, yet undefined."
"i thought someone had got murdered and dumped in here, but then the police rang up on the phone and said it was 700 years-plus old, so i wasn't really worried then," christian thompson, one of the boys who discovered the remains told the bbc when they were found in july. "a forensic anthropologist has been examining them to help identify when the individual passed away... today it has been confirmed that the remains are that of a woman from sub-saharan africa and are dated between 896ad and 1025ad," police said in the statement. bones discovered in river believed to be 1000 years old she's 1,000 years old and a long way from home. police knew that the bones were old, but this is the most accurate dating of the remains yet. the daily mail estimates that the skeleton of the ancient woman traveled about 3,000 miles from her home. in july, two english teens found human remains in the coln river in gloucestershire. the gloucestershire police announced their findings in a statement on their website. police brought in forensic investigators to find out more about the bones. police said that the remains will likely go to a museum or university.
however strange "i'm going for a run slash walk in the park" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, "i'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard." in digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing "slash" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible "and" or "or" if convenience is such a concern. if it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which curzan called "a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members." the most common use corresponds most closely to "and/or," but she said a fair number are "used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon." the person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of sour patch kids. english speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as geoffrey k. pullum, professor of linguistics at the university of edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. the strange word everyone is saying/texting not long after noticing friends and coworkers using "slash" in everyday conversation, i started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time. the slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. "with clauses," he wrote, "i think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'i think i'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible. after so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates ("8/30/2014") and fractions ("3/4 cup"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. the slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. either spelled out in five characters ("slash") or just one ("/"), i saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways. but everyone owns the english language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. "the most interesting implication to me," she said, "is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings." still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate "truth values for the elements it connects," curzan explained. tell that to anyone who considers themselves a "slash dj," to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. while it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. a 1977 edition of theodore bernstein's "the careful writer" referred to the simple "and/or" as "a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided." since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment ("hello exclamation point" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense. coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include "and," "but," "or" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses. typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. since then, curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on twitter. for example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see "boyhood" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. so maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. in other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. when the style guides and writers' handbooks i consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it "rarely necessary." grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a "coordinator." anne curzan, professor of english at the university of michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. correction: this story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of geoffrey k. pullum's last name. or to jezebel editor kara brown, who described robin thicke's "paula" as the singer's "most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage." change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (there's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in latin.) curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses. the slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching tv. it was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. doesn't seem like english at all, does it?" pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in "lexical rather than phrasal categories." using "slash" assigned more "truth value" to "walk" over "run." @ max's restaurant, sm mall of asia http://t.co/osswgvkla4 — uriel yu medellin (@itsmeuriel) august 4, 2014 but will it stick around? to certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. it's a match made in, um, some factory in china. the slash helps us present alternative descriptions. usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. we can't say. these days, many english speakers would disagree. (writer-slash-dj. financial-consultant-slash-dj. our meaning is clear. but they weren't. animal-whisperer-slash-dj.) breakfast slash lunch! "review slash indictment.") ("friendship slash rivalry." yum!
country singer delivers epic slam to westboro baptist church protesters country singer vince gill isn't afraid to confront the westboro baptist church head-on, and that's exactly what he did when members from the hate group decided to protest his missouri concert over the weekend. on sunday, sept. 8, gill stepped outside at the kauffman center for the performing arts in kansas city, mo., to face down some westboro baptist church members gathered on the sidewalk. nonprofit group planting peace announced that in october it will be staging a drag show at the equality house in topeka, kan., to draw attention to the anti-gay group and raise money for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) equality. "don't you know that you f**kers are lucky that you don't have a sign that says something about my wife?" the hate group purportedly decided to protest gill's concert because he is a divorced man who remarried, country music television noted. its godhatesfags website reveals the group has picketing plans at several places over the next two months, including a mumford & sons concert on sept. 20 and two florida high schools in october. the westboro baptist church compound is set to be in the center of the parade. by whorish woman, destruction pic.twitter.com/rrivksutci — westboro baptist (@wbcsays) september 8, 2013 "vince gill, what in the world are you doing out here?" apparently, that union doesn't sit too well with the wbc, best known for its anti-gay rhetoric, as well as its unwanted appearances at funerals. a wbc member can be heard asking, in a video of the confrontation uploaded to youtube. gill then called another picketer a "big dips**t" and later asked if they are the phelpses or just "the c team." grant, who has offered support to her gay fanbase, was previously married to christian musician gary chapman. "but, more importantly, what are you doing with another man's wife?" the 56-year-old musician was once married to sweethearts of the rodeo singer janis oliver. "don't you know that divorce plus remarriage equals adultery?" on sunday, the group also protested outside a michael buble concert. after their 1998 divorce, he married christian singer amy grant in 2000. westboro is about to get a protest of its own. "i came out to see what hatred really looked like in the face," gill responded. hey, vince gill-@vgcom: god hates adultery and violence to marriage covenant. he said a lot of stuff about forgiveness, about grace. you guys don't have any of that." "you know what else [jesus christ] said? watch gill's confrontation below. gill asked. she asked.

by knocking off 10 hours of work each week for a year, employees at a swedish nursing home were able to improve their health, cut back on sick leave, and enhance the care of their charges, the new york times reports. the owner of a start-up in stockholm, which operates on a six-hour day but didn’t take part in the study, says the shorter days have assisted the small company to double its revenue and profit for the past three years. "we thought doing a shorter workweek would mean we’d have to hire more, but it hasn’t resulted in that because everyone works more efficiently," the owner tells the times. while workers reported feeling better about the jobs and their contribution, employers that took part in the experiment found a 30-hour work week sharply reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, enhanced creativity, and reduced turnover. "we’ve had 40 years of a 40-hour workweek, and now we’re looking at a society with higher sick leave and early retirement," daniel bernmar, leader of the political party running the trial, said. under the experiment, which focused on the future of work in gothenburg, employees began working six-hour days at the same pay rate as their previous eight-hour days. in sweden, an experiment turns shorter workdays into bigger gains [the new york times] in sweden, an experiment turns shorter workdays into bigger gains [the new york times] while the trial initially cost the hospital an additional $123,000 a month, it reduced sick calls, and increased the efficiency of the healthcare workers. "we can’t pay people to not work," maria rydén, gothenburg’s deputy mayor, who is working to put an end to the trial, tells the times. there are 120 hours in a 5-day workweek, and for most working americans at least a third of that time is spent earning a living. sure, you’ve got 16-ish hours away from the job each day, but is that enough time to enjoy all your personal, family, community, and social commitments without becoming a harried, frazzled unproductive mess? an ongoing study out of sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity. "we want a new discussion in sweden about how work life should be to maintain a good welfare state for the next 40 years." one employee says that after just one week he was more energized and residents said their standard of care had improved. "what’s good is that we’re happy," one employee tells the times. although the tests have been helpful to both participating companies and employees, the concept hasn’t been greeted with open arms by everyone. some opponents of the option contend that the country’s economy would suffer from reduced competitiveness and strained finances, the times reports. "since we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time." the hospital’s orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. but unlike the start-up, it had to hire 15 additional workers. are shorter work days better for your health &amp; productivity? "and a happy worker is a better worker." sahlgrenska university hospital in gothenburg tried a similar trial last year.
i was behind the wheel when a self-driving uber failed — here's what happens uber is letting people experience its self-driving cars for the first time starting wednesday. the popular ride-hailing service is letting a select few people hail a self-driving car as part of a pilot in pittsburgh. uber let us get behind the wheel and experience what it's like to monitor a giant robot on wheels, but not everything went according to plan. the cars can drive only in certain locations, including pittsburgh's downtown and shadyside neighborhood. those taking rides through the pilot can ride free for now, but an uber representative said that may change.
many fans in croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair – as well as davor suker, the cff president who is seen by many as their puppet – and turned it into a tool for making money. finally, mamic was suspended from working at dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the vip lounge at the game against the czechs. they are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in croatian football. the fear, however, is that no one will give in: not the top people at cff, nor the ultras who are so fed up with them. a lot of people in croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely. and, ultimately, the losers will be the players and the supporters who would love nothing more than having their national team back. some radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the cff that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. the federation’s vice-president, zdravko mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from dinamo zagreb when he was chief executive there. mamic and vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long – and at the moment unsuccessful – campaign to have them removed via the legal system. their aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. "maybe it would be best if we don’t play at all," said ivan perisic, who scored the opening goal for croatia. croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the czech republic . he is right, nothing will be won by people in authority not taking control of this ugly situation. last year, they were taken into custody (mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. they claim to have lost faith in the croatian football federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. why would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? damir vrbanovic, the federation’s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case. croatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to friday’s match. among the players and coaching staff on friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. it is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this. "maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play." [the guardian] why did croatia fans disrupt their euro 2016 match against czech republic? and why would they then start a fight among themselves? sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.please install adobe flash tm and try again. the coach, ante cacic, added: "we are all to blame. they are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. let’s not start washing our hands from it." in fact, it goes further than that. alternatively upgrade to a modern browser. this is the background, though.
3 things to know about the future of virtual reality delegates use the gear vr (virtual reality) headset, manufactured by samsung electronics co., at the samsung unpacked launch event ahead of the mobile world congress in barcelona, spain, on sunday, feb. 21, 2016. a wireless rift or vive won't happen soon there are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the samsung gear vr and google cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the rift and the vive. "by the time we solve that, as an industry we're going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark," azor said. time sat down with frank azor, general manager of the dell-owned gaming pc manufacturer alienware, and nelson gonzalez, alienware's cofounder and former ceo, to discuss what they have learned about vr and where they believe it's headed. it's unlikely that we'll see a high-performance device like the rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn't advancing at the same pace as vr hardware. once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade." the former plug into your smartphone to deliver vr that's wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a pc to power their higher-end performance. although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. "headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well," said azor, also alienware's fourth employee. pcs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like intel, amd, and nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. the vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush. leap motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with vr environments without a controller. vr is an industry-wide effort the oculus rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. virtual reality will get more physical anyone who's seen or tried the htc vive knows that some physical activity is involved. that's the promise of virtual reality (vr) headsets, like the oculus rift and htc vive. strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. but the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more. this is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says gonzalez. "and not just sitting down; if you're a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. azor believes future vr devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells. but it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says azor. (the oculus rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. "everyone rallied around [the pc gaming] industry and now we have what we have today," he said. "the next evolution of vr would be where you participate physically in that vr world," gonzalez said. but what systems like the vive or playstation vr currently lack is a sense of touch. "vr is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems." as impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. "wireless technology is on a different schedule, that's where the issue comes in . startup thalmic labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the rift. so that kind of stuff, it's there, it's going to happen." that's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. games became more accessible on pcs as companies like steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content. azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. the latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward." it's unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those azor described will ever take shape. "well that's just two of the senses . incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. but some companies are certainly trying. (nintendo's virtual boy comes to mind.) below are the key highlights from our conversation. .
"one of the great honors of my life was to be invited to nelson mandela's home, spend private time and get to know him," winfrey said in a statement. according to the hollywood reporter, the own network has acquired the network television rights to premiere the late-former-south african president’s biopic in 2017. since mandela’s death on dec. 5, winfrey’s network has paid homage to the charismatic leader with the airing of various specials in addition to the media maven sharing her fond memories. "we're delighted that this film has landed a television home at oprah winfrey's own network," added weinstein co-chairman, harvey weinstein. "mandela" movie gets a tv premiere date despite its nationwide release to theaters on dec. 25, the weinstein co. has already set their sights on premiering "mandela: long walk to freedom" on television. "we couldn't be more honored to showcase this powerful film to the own viewers," said own president, erik logan. "nelson mandela was oprah's hero, and ultimately, the inspiration behind oprah's school in south africa. "partnering with them ensures the picture will continue to honor the memory of nelson mandela for years to come." his story of forgiveness and redemption is a gift not only to the people he touched, but to the world." being in his presence was like sitting with grace and majesty at the same time." his life was a gift to us all." "he will always be my hero. and he always loved to tell a good joke. "he was everything you've ever heard and more -- humble and unscathed by bitterness.
slice was found to have a congestive heart failure, along with a liver mass and was placed on a ventilator in intensive care shortly before his passing, according to a report in the sun sentinel. tragic details of kimbo slice's death have been released june 8th 2016 3.7k shares this post was originally published on thesportbible details have emerged about the tragic death of kevin ferguson, better known as 'kimbo slice'. the hospital also reported that slice had no history of illegal drug use and that foul play was not a factor in his death. the bearded slugger was famously known for his epic backyard street fights in florida before competing inside the ufc as well as professional boxing. doctors were preparing to fly him to cleveland to undergo a heart transplant, but he sadly passed away before that could happen. the former mma fighter and boxer tragically passed away on monday at the age of 42. slice was admitted to northwest medical center as a result of severe abdominal pains, shortness of breath and nausea.
"the dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue," blake emery, director of differentiation strategy for boeing commercial airplanes, told business insider in an interview. however, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness." while the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. in a study conducted by oklahoma state university with the help of boeing, researchers wrote: "some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. in 2015 boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever the study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. why does air pressure matter to passengers?​ for most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. one of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. "aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet," kent craver, boeing commercial airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told business insider in an interview. boeing is making a major change to its planes that could solve the biggest problem with air travel during the development of the 787 dreamliner, boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. the very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet. according to emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. as a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude." airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. at 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called "increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours" of exposure. all of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. "to lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin," emery added. however, boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777x without going to a composite body. however, unlike the composite dreamliner, the 777x, boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum. "we also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. "the research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level," emery said. "we know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well," a boeing spokesperson told us in an email. currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. the dreamliner won't be the only boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. in addition, airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. as result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. the company's upcoming 777x wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet. these measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system. this increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane. the symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. for the dreamliner, boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet. "so we decided to pressurize the dreamliner at 6,000 feet." "in fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level." the boeing 777x is set to enter service in 2019. but the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. why haven't we had this all along?

anyone using overwatch cheat programs are being banned by blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program’s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass blizzard’s security. fast forward to now, only a few days after the game’s official launch, and it’s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of overwatch players. here’s why blizzard is already banning thousands of overwatch players here’s why blizzard is already banning thousands of overwatch players it seems blizzard isn’t one to go back on its words. and no, using a vpn might not be enough since many users have reported that blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a vpn. no matter how smart you think you are, it’ll only end in one result, and that’s getting banned not once, but possibly forever. the moral of this story is clear as day, and it’s that you should not even think about cheating while playing overwatch. several users are reporting that blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. a few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game. the company, along with its partner netease, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. a pc gamer report mentions that blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. the company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating. last month it promised that it’ll ban any cheaters or hackers in overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided. this means if you’ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. the only solution: play fair and do not cheat. it unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. blizzard’s even taken a more brutal stance in china. that’s not all, however. simple?

when mr. ballmer retired as chief executive of microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized "i don’t, quote, ‘have anything to do.’" as he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the clippers — his wife, connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected. at one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, "if you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they’re really subsidies to the affluent, which i guess i hadn’t thought about them." on tuesday, mr. ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called usafacts. "because i’m a citizen, i don’t care whether i give my money to a, b or c. i just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what’s going on." "you know, when i really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, amazon or apple, i’d get their 10-k and read it," he told me in a recent interview in new york. "now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like," mr. ballmer said. "most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded," mr. ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. that conversation led mr. ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. with an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in seattle and made a grant to the university of pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. "it’s wonky, it’s this, it’s that, but it’s the greatest depth you’re going to get, and it’s accurate." suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have. after all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net. i pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because i don’t want anybody being able to think that factors in. in an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, mr. ballmer’s project may serve as a powerful antidote. her answer: "a, it won’t, because there are things government doesn’t get to, and b, you’re missing it." the database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments. but as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data — which rebut his preconceptions — could change his own politics. for example, mr. ballmer, said: "you know it’s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? using his website, usafacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: how much revenue do airports take in and spend? one rule mr. ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias. mr. ballmer calls it "the equivalent of a 10-k for government," referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make. "i mean it’s funny, but i didn’t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors." for mr. ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data. there is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, "along with other data, but not a total," he said. "people can disagree about what to do — i’m not going to tell people what to do." what he found surprised him guess what steven a. ballmer has been up to for the last several years. "we’re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — i think of this as another," he said, referring to himself and his wife. he hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports. "i would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions," mr. ballmer said. want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? "and by the way, i check it with google, just to make sure there’s nothing i’m missing." he created a database to "figure out what the government really does with the money." he sought to "figure out what the government really does with the money," mr. ballmer said. want to know what percentage of americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? "then people say, ‘those damn bureaucrats!’" mr. ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. it’s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it tuesday. he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. "you’ve got to look at federal, state and local together," mr. ballmer said. at the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table. "but come on, doesn’t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?" you can have your own reaction; i was a little surprised by that." "let’s say it costs three, four, five million a year," he said. but first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself. but, he said, people ought to base their opinions "on common data sets that are believable." so how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation’s data? he instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page. (no, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the los angeles clippers.) he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. mr. ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can’t report the data." "this is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. people who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees." and they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows. but neither option led him to what he was looking for. mr. ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. "and you say, o.k., what are the other big blocks?" but i feel like it’s a civic contribution more than anything else." altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants. "how many people work for government in the united states?" before he started, mr. ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this. "i don’t even deduct this for my taxes. the government is not allowed to collect the number." that is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. you can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways. what percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? "my favorite one, of course: i go to bing," he said. his first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. he has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. "i’m happy to fund the damn thing." i was a little surprised by that. mr. ballmer replied, "no, i’m not." "don’t look, don’t look!" "well, let’s look at that. "take the mortgage deduction," he continued. "i can’t show it! i didn’t know that." would you have guessed that?" mr. ballmer recalled telling her. that’s in there. but this created its own challenges. his other big surprises? but the n.r.a. "almost 24 million. mr. ballmer continued. "i love this one!" "what really happens?" i’m shocked! really? government hospitals. "well, active-duty military, war fighters.
so, when his buddy danny kolzow, a 23-year-old nurse at baylor all saints in fort worth, tx, found himself in need of a kidney, mcmillan didn’t hesitate to find out if he could donate one of his. when you think about your good friends, many things come to mind: how bland life would be without them, how they make you laugh and smile when you need it, and how they are there to support you in any situation. he can barely believe his good luck: not only does he get a kidney, but he knows that he also has a great friend who will be by his side through thick and thin. for 24-year-old graham mcmillan, the answer is simple: there is simply no limit to what he would do for his friends. he has balloons and a sign in hand that reads, "heard urine need of a kidney, want mine?" he decided to surprise his friend with the good news, and did so in the most incredible way. you may even ask yourself the question — what would i do for them in return? the gift of life and the gift of friendship are both priceless! then you see what's on the floor next to them... in this emotional clip, mcmillan walks into the hospital where kolzow works. he tackles a nurse at the hospital. the moment kolzow sees him, he understandably breaks down into tears. as it turned out, he was a match! it seems like the young man is quite the jokester!
source:  harvard business review imagine that you're teaching a geometry class, and you've volunteered to stay after school one day a week to help one of your students, alex, improve his understanding of geometry. dr grant and mr rebele explain that you need to remember three key things when giving to other people: 'being thoughtful about how you help, when you help, and whom you help.' 'when they don’t protect themselves, their investments in others can cause them to feel overloaded and fatigued, fall behind in their work goals, and face more stress and conflict at home', they said. their answers allowed the authors to predict how well their students would do in their exams at the end of the year. c. tell alex that it's nice that he wants to help juan, but he really needs to focus on his own work in order to catch up. their work shows it's about balancing time so when you help other people you don't set yourself back in the process. not only in teaching, but selfless people suffer most in workplaces and find themselves drowning in admin and unable to pursue their own goals as a result. 'although givers are the most valuable people in organizations, they’re also at the greatest risk for burnout', the authors wrote in the harvard business review. in an article for the harvard business review, wharton school of the university of pennsylvania professor, dr adam grant and wharton people analytics researcher reb rebele explore the 'generosity burnout'. their research also showed people who protect their own time can give the most long-term contribution. schedule a separate after-school session to help juan, so you can better understand his individual needs. they believe that selflessness at work leads to exhaustion, and ironically often hurts the people you intended to help. at the start of the year they asked them questions about their approach to helping others. surprisingly, the pupils with teachers who answered (a) did the worst in their end of year exams. and in the workplace putting your needs before those of your colleagues is often seen as selfish behaviour. why you should be selfish at work we're always being encouraged to help others before we help ourselves. giving at the expense of your own well-being damages your chance of long-term success. give in a way that is in your own interest and preserves your own energy resources. he asks if you'll also help his friend juan, who isn't in your class. don't be afraid to refer work to other people when you don't have time. in the end, they were damaging the very students they wanted to help. in their currently unpublished research, authors dr grant and mr rebele studied a range of jobs. one data set came from a study conducted with more than 400 teachers in schools throughout the us. d. tell alex that juan should ask his own teacher for help. the teachers who protected themselves and were less selfless got their students better marks. no one can be available all the time to help other people. 5- dedicate blocks of time to giving rather than doing it all the time. 'selfless educators exhausted themselves trying to help everyone with every request', the authors said. invite juan to sit in on your geometry sessions with alex. but new research says being selfless at work can backfire. amplify your impact - look for ways to help many people in a single gesture. 6 - avoid people who only take - they'll drain your energy. here is a sample question from their test, quoted in business insider: 1. it'll make you more focussed and effective. prioritise - say yes when it matters most. 2. a. what would you do? 3. 4. b.
here's how the times summarizes it: "the poor in some cities—big ones like new york and los angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like birmingham, ala.—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. "it is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy us adults," wrote nobel prize–winning economist angus deaton in an article that accompanied the study in jama, "whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way." poor people in and around birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012. the big finding from stanford economist raj chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live. in many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some new york values. in poverty-pocked areas in the midwest and the south, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy. the places where the poor lived the longest include new york and san francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. in that context, the publication, in the journal of the american medical association (jama), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. but in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter." and the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty. one reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born americans. for the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. the one strange trick that will make you live longer meditating inside a beautiful stock-photo room filled with plants is just one health benefit not available to poor people. but if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. "the jama paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor," noted the times. that's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. photo via getty reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. the report, covered widely by the new york times and pretty much every other outlet on monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. the poorest people in america are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can i interest you in a $700 juicer? new york's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. "race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence." seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. but the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known. the rich are not like you or me: they can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. the richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. "social marginalization is not reducible to single variables," wrote steven woolf and jason purnell in a jama editorial. the obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? san francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; new york abolished trans fats. "health is about more than healthcare," woolf and purnell wrote. any study like this comes with some caveats. "but there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity."

but when flynn was only 7 months old, a stranger accidentally put hailey in harm's way by stopping to pet flynn — and the incident illustrates exactly why working dogs should never be pet or played with while they're working. why you should never pet a service dog flynn the dog does a lot to help out his 17-year-old human, hailey ashmore: he can open and close doors, fetch her parents and, most importantly, alert her to oncoming seizures. "it becomes almost an extension of that person, just like someone's wheelchair ... besides the fact that the dog is part of who you are, that touching can distract the dog from what they need to do." hailey ashmore reiss explained that assistance dogs are trained to go from "being on to off in a few seconds," from hanging out with a chew toy to helping their human in the blink of an eye. hailey ashmore "since flynn was only about 7 months at the time of the accident, he was, and still is, learning to ignore people petting him," hailey explained. hailey ashmore hailey was visiting her dad at work when someone began petting flynn like he was just a regular pup. but in just a moment of distraction flynn had missed a crucial opportunity to warn hailey about an oncoming seizure. cci is a nonprofit that trains assistance dogs, including companion dogs and service dogs, and then matches them to people with disabilities. hailey's story illustrates just how important service animals are for their humans — and why their vests shouldn't be ignored. dogs like flynn provide crucial medical assistance, and while they're working, they need to be 100 percent focused. hailey has had flynn since november 2014, when the australian shepherd puppy began his training with her as a medical alert dog. hailey sums it up this way: "if you wouldn't do it to a wheelchair, please don't do it to our dogs." "the dog is part of a team," jessica reiss, of canine companions for independence (cci) told the dodo. "i thought i had 10 minutes to get safe, take medication and call somebody for help," hailey told the dodo. when strangers stop to play with assistance dogs, they can interfere with their work. "i immediately told him to stop," hailey told the dodo. cci does not train medical alert dogs like flynn. "we understand our dogs are super cute, but they are really important for our safety and health." "unfortunately, i didn't and ended up getting a nasty rug burn." when he did warn her, it was too late. "they're not a piece of equipment," reiss said. "they can be distracted."
he is the first member of the extended royal family to come out as gay, and whilst he is happier now he’s still finding his feet in his new relationship. the first person in the royal family has just come out as gay the queen’s cousin has become the first member of the british royal family to come out as gay. when i was growing up, it was known as ‘the love that dare not speak its name’, but what’s amazing now is how far we have all come in terms of acceptance." "coming out is such a funny phrase but it’s what i suppose i did in a rather roundabout way, emerging to a place i’m happy to be. i have struggled with my sexuality and in some ways i still do; it has been a real journey to reach this point." lord ivar mountbatten has revealed that he is now dating a man after a lifelong struggle with his sexuality. whilst the couple have a strict no public affection rule, they are now out to all of their friends and family. whilst having a boyfriend has provided the lord with some learning curves, it’s also been a blessing in disguise. the couple met on a skiing holiday in march, and the relationship has been a key landmark for them both. mountbatten is the queen’s cousin, the great great great grandson of queen victoria and the great-nephew of earl mountbatten of burma. up to this point, i have had a heterosexual lifestyle, so living with a man is really new. "neither of us wanted to have relationships which were transitory; the stereotypical view of gay relationships is that they are too fleeting, too frequent." "i am a lot happier now, though i am still not 100% comfortable with being gay," he told the mail on sunday. coyle said: "i went to a village yoga class with penny and people thought i was her new boyfriend. "finding james means i will not have to lie to anyone or grow old on my own." prince harry previously joked that he might try a relationship with a man if it doesn’t work out with women. "being a mountbatten was never the problem, it was the generation into which i was born. the father of three divorced from his wife penelope thompson after 17 years of marriage in 2011. the 53-year-old came out in an interview with his boyfriend james coyle, 54. she had to tell them: no, he’s ivar’s, not mine." and his ex, penelope thomson, goes to yoga with his new boyfriend. his daughters like having another man in the house, rather than a step-mother. when a newspaper claimed that she opposed gay people marrying, buckingham palace sent journalists pinknews articles claiming that she supports equality. "simply talking about it in public is a huge step for me. now everyone in our family knows and could not be more supportive." the queen is believed to have supported same-sex marriage. last year, prince william visited a school to participate in a lesson to tackle homophophic bullying. "in different ways, we both struggled. one step at a time." said mountbatten.
a man who retired at 34 explains one bad savings habit that everyone should avoid in august, brandon — better known as the mad fientist — retired at just 34 years old to get there, brandon (who doesn't use his last name online for privacy reasons) chose to live frugally in rural vermont, where he managed to save and invest about 70% of his after-tax income in 2014, brandon and his wife —who has no interest in retiring early and keeps her finances largely separate from her husband's — moved to scotland, where he continued to work for a few more years, eventually putting away enough to allow him to retire at 34. when an audience member asked brandon and this panelists to share what kept them motivated on the path to financial independence during an episode of his "financial independence podcast," he responded that instead of struggling to stick to his savings goals, he coped with putting away too much. "focus on the power that you're getting along the way with all that money that you're saving up, and use that power to make your life a lot better along the way," he says. "i never wanted to stop working, but rather i wanted to have the time and freedom to work on things that are important to me." by avoiding anything that involved spending money, brandon ended up dodging his friends and depriving himself of even the little things that brought him joy. while brandon advocates financial independence, he stresses that anyone striving for early retirement should avoid becoming so obsessed with it that they isolate themselves. "it's always been about 'financial independence' for me and not really 'early retirement,'" he told business insider . "one extra dollar in your bank account is not going to make you really happier," he warns. "i just didn't want to do anything that involved spending money. "[i] went so hardcore that i made myself really unhappy during the process," he says. but his journey to financial independence taught him a valuable lesson: saving isn't everything. i just wanted to get there as soon as possible." early retirement is supposed to be freeing and empowering, not constricting. "don't sacrifice happiness for that final number in the bank."
our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of new york city often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. when i went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: "my husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if i left." and my son might get a b on a spelling test instead of his usual a, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as i would've if i was home. the annoying question no mom wants to hear when she goes on vacation last month, i left my three children for almost two full weeks to travel across nicaragua with my stepmother and sister. but what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question i was asked again and again from fellow moms: "who is watching your kids?" the trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no wi-fi (and no english), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. the list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. but as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. he picks up from gymnastics every wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. and i promise when you do, i will never ask you who is taking care of them. he changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. my 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. i might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map. because i knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. most popular truth be told, i work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. the 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. they dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track. last year, there were long periods where he left every tuesday and returned on friday afternoon. no, i didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. but my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when i got back. kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. upon my return, a friend said she could "never do what you did." fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them. her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. if i were a single mother, the question might be valid. no, i didn't leave them with the grandparents. my toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. he texted me on wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip. but that doesn't make daddy less capable of it. he is a parent just like me. and that's exactly the reason to go. daddies get to go out in the world. but it's not easy when one spouse travels. a job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. this is why i needed a vacation. my husband is not a babysitter. he is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. but that is all i did. it's a fact my husband understands well. my husband regularly goes to california for work. leave the kids with daddy. but my husband knows the score. my husband was with them. so why the question? why are we accepting this as normal? why would anyone find this shocking? because i will already know. "how long are you gone again?" it's good for everyone. mommy has it all under control. and i do. and they were. so go on. ok, so it's true. it's obvious, right? mommies stay home. i had to laugh. not without massive amounts of help. mostly. alone.
foursquare's dennis crowley: this mistake will get you called out on social media building loyalty with your customers is crucial for growing a business, but trying too hard can also get your company skewered on social media. "there are a lot of brands that don't do it that well, and it's a little bit like watching a train wreck as they try to be authentic, funny, and witty," he says. to ensure you're building a good rapport with users, don't be disingenuous or misrepresent your brand's identity on social media. take it from foursquare co-founder dennis crowley, who attributes much of his geolocation company's success to early engagement with users on social media channels. "prioritizing that and making it an important part of what we did at foursquare was one of the things that got us to where we are today." "it's really clear when you're trying too hard and being really inauthentic," he says. "we had a nice, playful, flirty tone with a lot of the users back in the day," he says. "you'll definitely get called out for it," crowley says. so what separates strong social media interactions from disastrous ones? according to crowley, the key is authenticity.
google celebrated what would have been celia cruz's 88th birthday monday with a doodle honoring the cuban singer who rose to international stardom as one of the world's greatest salsa singers. born úrsula hilaria celia de la caridad cruz alfonso to a working-class family in havana in 1925, cruz took up singing as a child -- an interest later encouraged by her aunt, who introduced her to the world of cuba's nightclubs, according to billboard. it was in the united states that cruz would become an international icon and earn the moniker "the queen of salsa," after launching a solo career with percussionist tito puente, and performing with the fania all stars in the 1970s. "there have been many posthumous tributes to celia in these last ten years, but this one by google is certainly one of the most important and far-reaching," omer pardillo-cid, sole executor of the celia cruz estate, said in a press release. today would have been her 88th birthday — jacquellena carrero (@jacquellenac) october 21, 2013 yesssss today google's page is dedicated to celia cruz! a student of cuba's conservatory of music, cruz's career took off in 1950 when she joined la sonora matancera, one of cuba's most prominent dance orchestras. #lavidaesuncarnaval — carla saavedra (@carlasaavedra) october 21, 2013 the outpouring of emotion wouldn't surprise those familiar with the artist's work. by the time of her death at 77 two years later, she had raked in 10 grammys, honorary doctorates from yale and the university of miami, and a smithsonian lifetime achievement award. "it's as if the earth opened her mouth to talk and sing," marvette perez, curator of latino history and culture at the national museum of american history in washington, told npr in 2005. the cuban government refused to let her visit the island to attend her father's funeral years later, according to the new york times. as celia told the new york times in an interview: "when people hear me sing, i want them to be happy, happy, happy. the outpouring of emotion wouldn't surprise those familiar with the artist's work. thank you, google, for dedicating today's doodle to one of salsa's greatest singers. the singer left the island while on tour with la sonora matancera in 1960, shortly after the cuban revolution, and never returned. the salsa legend behind the google doodle web surfers woke up monday to a sprinkling of azúcar. it's celia cruz birthday and there's azucar in the google page. she continued cutting records and performing as a solo artists well into her seventies, including the award-winning "la negra tiene tumbao" in 2001. the doodle won plaudits from celia's dedicated fans, who took to twitter to cheer the internet mammoth's artwork. i don't want them thinking about when there's not any money, or when there's fighting at home. — arlene davila (@arlenedavila1) october 21, 2013 loving this @google doodle honoring celia cruz! she became famous for her booming voice, energetic performances punctuated by her signature outbursts of "azúcar!" — theresa socash (@tsocash) october 21, 2013 celia cruz would've been 88 today.

de gea to the bernabeu is a transfer rumour that seems destined to live in the gossip pages for eternity but the 25-year-old has given the most definitive statement yet on his intention to remain a manchester united player as de gea slammed the media for discussing the move without any genuine knowledge of what's going on. de gea carried on to express his excitement with the arrival of mourinho and believes that the former chelsea boss brings with him a winner's mentality, something that is badly required around old trafford if united are to start challenging for premier league titles again. manchester united fans will certainly be relieved with david de gea's latest comments many expected the appointment of jose mourinho to pump the brakes on any talk of david de gea heading to real madrid this summer. but, alas, last summer's annoyingly long transfer saga started up again this week with rumours that the recent champions league winners were set to renew their interest in the spanish stopper. "i know how all this works, but what i think is disrespectful is when people start making out that it's something i have said. "i've got three more years on my contract with united and the desire to win more titles here." "people talk a lot and they know little," de gea said in quotes appearing in marca. "talk about jose mourinho and you're talking about a winner," de gea continued. "winning is united's, jose's and my philosophy. "we can make a great team and i welcome him."
ottessa moshfegh's stories of selfish people doing foul things are must-reads the protagonist of "malibu," the third short story in ottessa moshfegh’s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime tv. after her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the man booker prize, she notoriously confessed to the guardian that she’d written the book as a joke to get attention. this may sound unappealing, yet moshfegh’s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we’re not such an elevated species as we’d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast. what other reviewers think: the new york times: "if there’s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it’s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes." ‘i forgot the broom.’" homesick for another world by ottessa moshfegh penguin press, $26.00 published january 3, 2017 the bottom line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book. it’s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it’s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. he’s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he’ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient kleenex. she quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women’s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. when he goes to a meet-up he’s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. the bottom line: moshfegh’s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore. the young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what i would do for the long weekend, if i’d see my folks over christmas, and so forth. they’re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they’re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. though it’s out of focus and context-free, he’s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island. in much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into "good" and "bad." as in her debut novel, eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in homesick for another world are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. he recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: "i sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. ottessa moshfegh has previously published a novel, eileen, which was shortlisted for the man booker prize and was given the hemingway foundation/pen award. the bottom line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book. in either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. suddenly, he’s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he’s now certain was unfaithful. he finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: "he took out his phone and reread all her texts again. she has a brief fling with a local: "i still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home." in a story called "the beach boy," a man’s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. she hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job. moshfegh’s talent is unique, and her characters — unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic — are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness." the old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming." "as good-looking as i was, i was scared nobody would ever marry me," he admits. npr: "there’s not a story in homesick for another world that’s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. moshfegh’s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people. in one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. in one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. she has published her short fiction in the paris review and the new yorker, among other outlets. she’d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. "marcia was gone for good now," moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, "and he felt like celebrating." she gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs. in another story, a high school english teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. the women in homesick for another world are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. nobody ever said, ‘oh, so beautiful!’" moshfegh’s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. reading homesick for another world offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the british sitcom "peep show." there was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, i suppose. opening lines: "my classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns’ lounge. the unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to moshfegh’s cool, matter-of-fact prose. notable passage: "her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. there’s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. when her thighs appeared, i saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. they crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt. fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters ― and readers who don’t mind being grossed out. they were like a girl’s hands, but with hair. oh, and then there are his hands. one was old and one was young. who are you?’ she sounded desperate, he thought. ‘what do you think about these?’ i asked. she seemed not to know that she was bleeding. "’oh, shit,’ she said when she reached the landing. another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. nobody marries men with hands like that." one nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. he develops a meth addiction. nobody ever gave me the answer i wanted. i used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. he had made a grievous mistake, he thought." their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. i never understood the nuns. "i had small hands. she never really tries to leave. who will read it? ‘i am very lonely and troubled. who wrote it?
officials in washington and riyadh were already on edge because president obama is said to be seriously considering declassifying 28 pages of a congressional report into the 2001 attacks that some say indicate the hijackers, 15 of whom were saudi arabian, received support, explicit or otherwise, from the country’s vast royal family. the treasury department’s disclosure answers one of the questions surrounding the relationship between the two countries and shows that the monarchy, while an important player in the u.s. financial system, doesn’t have as much leverage as many likely believed. last month saudi officials warned the country would sell off $750 billion worth of treasuries and other assets in the states if congress approved a bill that would allow the monarchy to be sued in american courts for any role in the sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. saudi arabia holds roughly $117 billion of the u.s. government’s debt, according to treasury department data that disclosed the country’s holdings for the first time in over 40 years. the kingdom’s holdings of american treasury bills have previously been grouped in with the 14 nations that comprise the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), like kuwait and venezuela. the $116.8 billion saudi arabia owns puts it in the top 12 foreign nations with holdings of u.s. debt, falling between india and singapore. the u.s. started releasing data on foreign ownership of treasuries in 1974, but had never specified how much saudi arabia holds. intelligence officials have been reviewing whether to make the pages public since 2014 and are due to deliver a recommendation to the president. together, those countries own about $281 billion in u.s. debt, down from $298.4 billion in january. a freedom of information act request filed by a freedom of information act request filed by bloomberg news led to the treasury department breaking down the assets by country. saudi holdings of treasuries peaked at $123.6 billion in january, the data released monday show. whatever the recommendation, the white house has said obama could ultimately use his executive authority to make the pages public. the numbers were made public as part of the treasury’s regular monthly reports. the disclosure comes during an unusually tense time in u.s.-saudi relations. just how much us debt does saudi arabia own? its total pales in comparison to china’s whopping $1.3 trillion and japan’s $1.1 trillion.
the letter went on to say that none of the pigs in the pen were chihiro's parents, which she knew because "as a 10-year-old girl, could understand the difference because she had overcome difficulties and had managed to acquire the 'energy to live' — which is something everyone can do naturally," the letter stated according to a translation by rocketnews24. japan's market crash of 1991 threw the country into a financial crisis so severe it's remembered today as the "lost decades" and miyazaki used chihiro's parents as a reminder that greed leads to devastating consequences. albeit being a bit vague, the meaning behind chihiro's parents transformation deepens the theme on greed and sheds light on a part of japanese history that most spirited away fans don't know much about. twitter user @0910noncha sent some questions about the film to studio ghibli earlier this year, and to her delight, she got a thoughtful reply from a ghibli employee, which she posted to her twitter account on july 9. the letter explained that once someone transforms into a pig, it's irreversible, and miyazaki used the metaphor to describe the real world and how greed changes people. she wanted to know why the chihiro's parents turned into pigs, what was in their food, and how she managed to pass her final exam. i will forever live in the fear of finding out my parents have turned into pigs, perhaps somewhat irrationally, mostly because that detail was never clear to me after watching the movie fifteen years ago. in the letter studio ghibli explained that the swine transformation represented the greed that took place during japan's bubble economy of the 80s. studio ghibli solves one of spirited away's biggest mysteries hayao miyazaki's spirited away gave me nightmares worse than after watching the exorcist. spirited away fans have long speculated over the deeper meaning of fantastical moments in the film , and now we're finally getting some answers. the metaphor also serves as a reminder of the richness behind ghibli films. "this doesn’t just apply to the fantasy world," it read. but today, unsettled viewers might be able to find some peace.
still from "the future was desert part ii" (2016) by sophia al-maria witnessing this evolution inspired her to coin the term "gulf futurism," inspired by "the idea that time travel had literally occurred in one generation [in qatar], from a sort of pre-agrarian society -- at least in terms of bedouin culture -- deep into hyper capitalism and consumerism," as al-maria describes it. while much time is spent thinking of digital art as forward thinking and innovative, the cost of this innovation may be a reduced life span for the artworks, which have used the technological tools available to them in their time. "the thing is that people's concept of art is still very much object based," she explains, "so even with a video piece, people will expect there to be something to play it on." the title, al-maria says, is in part a reference to the american "national holiday of shopping," but also a nod to the holy nature of fridays in islam. techno-pessimism more than anything, gulf futurism is perhaps an investigation into some of the more negative aspects of a hyper-connected digital society that can sometimes be a lonely place -- a perspective al-maria describes as "techno-pessimistic." her solo show " black friday ," which opens at new york's whitney museum of american art on july 26, will comprise over 100 new videos, screened on a series of broken or rejected consumer electronics. in "black friday" al-maria will show the tangible results of such development; the physical waste produced by a society obsessed with the latest electronic gadget. planned obsolescence growing up in qatar provided a unique vantage point from which to witness the rapid evolution of history, in a commercial and technological sense. while the rise of the internet was a key aspect of her formative years, her work often deals with the isolating nature of the digital space. maybe it doesn't create community in the way that people think because with the ability to post whatever you want at any time, you also get the ugly side," al-maria says. the exhibition "posits the thought that shopping malls have become a kind of replacement for religious structures in our contemporary consumer society," she says. as al-maria puts it: "there's planned obsolescence in the devices, so there's planned obsolescence in the art. still from "between distant bodies" (2013) by sophia al-maria "a few years ago i had a real feeling of heaviness through things like facebook, like i was dragging the ghost of every person i had ever met. born to an american mother and a qatari bedouin father, she spent her childhood in the us before moving to qatar. exemplifying of a new generation of creative polymaths, the writer-filmmaker-artist has produced photos, directed films, written articles and screenplays, and published a critically acclaimed memoir, "the girl who fell to earth." (cnn) american-qatari artist sophia al-maria is preparing for the biggest exhibition of her career. there, she experienced the intense and rapid technological and cultural development of the gulf. this phenomenon of fervent consumerism also feeds into our perception of what constitutes a piece of art. born in 1983, she describes herself as an early digital native, part of the first crop of millennials. he's commissioning a series of features on the topic of art and technology. gulf futurism "black friday" sits comfortably in al-maria's roster of projects. in her memoir al-maria talks about being brought up between two vastly different cultures. in the digital age, is shopping america's new religion? "there's so much work lost. it's kind of tragic really." this month, art basel global director marc spiegler joins cnn style as guest editor .
the reality is probably not that bad, but also not as click-worthy: research from the transamerica center for retirement studies indicates that nearly three-quarters of millennials are saving for retirement and that we started doing so at an earlier age than previous generations. but you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a roth ira (check roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option. use a roth ira or a roth 401(k) contributions to a traditional 401(k) or ira are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. what you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments. take that risk through index funds about 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. and because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement. you can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of u.s. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified. to put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. but a 2015 study from blackrock found that millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. the best way to do that is not by dumping your money into apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds. history illustrates this: a portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by vanguard. that's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place. if your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. 5 essential investing moves for millennials if you believe recent reports from the web, you probably think millennials are financial floozies, trading their retirement money for venti lattes. there might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out. khan academy is a good place to start, as is nerdwallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. there are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. you can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in nerdwallet's piece on investing in your 20s. if an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another. factor in inflation   a force that millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money. at this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. that $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. wells fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more. put a lid on fees you can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. what we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in vegas without the free drinks. sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term. keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. say hello to risk risk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites. a portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. at a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000. every dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. at today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. those funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. get an education at least this one will be free. in investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. to see how valuable that is, use a roth ira calculator. here are five crucial moves millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties. could you lose money and never collect that premium? why choose a roth? 1. investing is understandably scary. 4. 5. 2. 3.
the american veterinary medical association supports the procedure, but "only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents an above normal health risk for its owner(s)." the veterinary procedure has been offered for many years, but that could cease to be the case, at least in new york, if legislation to ban the practice goes though. "it's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off," veterinarian jennifer conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a daily freeman reporter. declawing your cat could become illegal if you live in this state depending on who you ask, cat declawing is either feline torture or a necessary evil. to that, assemblywoman linda rosenthal, who is sponsoring the bill, says: "i've heard so many times: 'i have expensive furniture! to remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. the human equivalent, as the human society of the united states describes it, is "cutting off each finger at the last knuckle." most popular many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture. the gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in new york. for those who don't own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it's a very serious medical operation. this ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the u.s, the associated press reports. the bill is currently with the senate and assembly, but no voting date has been determined, reports the huffington post. i have nice drapes!​ if your standard is, 'i need pristine furniture,' don't get a cat." but when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? meanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. why would mother nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?" still, 130 new york vets are completely supportive of the ban. the controversial practice is already banned in los angeles, australia, britain and many countries in europe. that's why we do it," says veterinarian new york city richard goldstein. medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. kristine brabson, site director of goodhousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones.

— trey hobsontm (@treyhob21) february 10, 2014 never cared if michael was gay... as long as he put that pass rush on the qb and made my job easier i didnt give a damn... — trey hobsontm (@treyhob21) february 10, 2014 sam had been planning on coming out publicly before the nfl draft but he had initially intended for the news to break after the nfl combine, according to outsports' behind-the-scenes look at the announcement. "michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he’s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn’t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we’re all on the same team and we all support each other. should any nfl executives or coaches with questions turn to missouri head football coach gary pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates. if michael doesn’t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, i don’t think there’s any way he has the type of season he put together." a 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted southeastern conference for the 2013 season, sam made his announcement just two weeks before the nfl scouting combine begins on feb. 22 in indianapolis. after coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, sam starred on the field as the missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the cotton bowl. football star comes out as gay former missouri defensive lineman michael sam, named a first-team all-american after the 2013 season, has publicly come out as gay. "having played division i football as a closeted gay man, i recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, " patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the university of maryland, said in a statement. "by rewriting the script for countless young athletes, michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the nfl," ellis said in a statement. "we’re really happy for michael that he’s made the decision to announce this, and we’re proud of him and how he represents mizzou," pinkel said in a statement. although several former nfl players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. a month later, former u.s. national soccer team player robbie rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional north american team sport when he stepped onto the field for the l.a. galaxy of the mls. — michael sam (@mikesamfootball) february 10, 2014 while sam was thankful for the support he received, athlete ally youth programs director akil patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others. "in the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. given the type of year that sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming nfl draft by espn scouts inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. the college football standout is eligible for the 2014 nfl draft and is poised to become the first active openly gay player in the league's history. "if michael sam can navigate this transition into the nfl as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. "i don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet," an anonymous nfl player personnel assistant said, reported pete thamel and thayer evans of sports illustrated. the 24-year-old from hitchcock, texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the tigers' 2013 campaign. with the nfl's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, sam's draft position will be watched closely in may. sam recounted for the new york times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year. the general manager of one nfl team told peter king of sports illustrated that he believed sam would not even be drafted after coming out. "at the senior bowl, it was the first question i got from the scouts almost every time," one of sam's agents, joe barkett, told outsports. "he didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the internet was true. he spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to the new york times and espn on sunday. several unnamed nfl personnel members interviewed by sports illustrated after sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock. wanting to come out on his own terms, sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with espn and the new york times on sunday. more athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. "with acceptance of lgbt people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that america is ready for an openly gay football star." one of sam's former teammates at missouri, trey hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on twitter. i think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time." the 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. his plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the senior bowl in january were asking about his sexuality. meanwhile, glaad president sarah kate ellis contended that the leadership displayed by sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster. "we admire michael sam’s honesty & courage," the nfl said in a statement released on sunday, via ian rapoport of nfl.com. "i looked in their eyes, and they just started shaking their heads -- like, finally, he came out," sam said. and it's kind of a nervous process, but i know what i want to be ... after the news broke, sam took to twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out. in april 2013, veteran nba center jason collins came out with a first-person piece in sports illustrated. i want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. i want to be a football player in the nfl." "i am an openly, proud gay man," sam told espn. "they would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? though its old news to us its a great move by a great guy. "i understand how big this is," sam told espn. any player with ability and determination can succeed in nfl." shout out to my former teammate michael sam. i am proud to tell my story to the world! they didn't ask that about another client, tom hornsey. "michael is a football player. they only asked it about michael." to call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. no one has done this before. it'd chemically imbalance an nfl locker room and meeting room." "it's a big deal. wish u much success in the future! who is his girlfriend?

why americans think we are having stronger storms most americans think climate change, and more frequent and severe natural disasters are linked, according to a new huffpost/yougov poll that also finds most think human activity is at least partially responsible for the changing climate. among republicans, only 15 percent said that human activity is the primary cause of climate change, although a total of 53 percent said that humans are at least a contributing factor. according to the new poll, conducted after typhoon haiyan devastated the philippines earlier this month, 55 percent of americans think climate change is related to more frequent and severe natural disasters, while only 23 percent do not. eighty-five percent of democrats said humans are at least partially responsible for climate change, including 55 percent who said human activity is the primary cause. only 10 percent of respondents said human activity is not contributing to climate change at all and 9 percent said climate change is not occurring. sixty-eight percent of independents said humans are at least contributing, but only 29 percent said they are the primary cause. in total, 70 percent of respondents said they think human activity is having at least some impact on climate change. the poll shows that the vast majority of americans think humans are contributing at least somewhat to climate change, but differ on just how much. although scientists can't say with certainty whether a specific storm was caused by climate change, rising sea levels make storm surges from hurricanes and typhoons potentially more deadly in coastal areas, contributing to increased destruction. seventy-two percent of democrats and 52 percent of independents, but only 39 percent of republicans said that they are related. the huffpost/yougov poll was conducted nov. 14-15 among 1,000 u.s. adults using a sample selected from yougov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult u.s. population. the poll finds that 28 percent of americans think typhoon haiyan specifically was caused by climate change. another 36 percent said human activity is not the cause, but contributes to climate change. another 32 percent said it was not, and 41 percent said they weren't sure. but only 34 percent said human activity is the primary cause. forty-four percent of republicans said that they're not. factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance. but republicans and independents were less convinced.
the ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail. despite hillary clinton’s large margins in miami-dade county and broward county, trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the deep south panhandle to the interior of florida to peninsula’s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the midwest who pushed him over the top. donald trump’s stunning win in florida was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide on tuesday: despite losing big to hillary clinton in diverse, urban areas of south florida, trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters. but after that, as election day votes poured in, trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m. by 9:10 p.m., trump’s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over clinton. two weeks ago during a meeting at trump’s golf club in doral, sources said, wiles successfully made the case to trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more republican absentee ballot voters. by the end of the night, trump’s lead was so big that, even if turnout in florida was modeled at 80 percent – far higher than recent elections – clinton would still not win if she beat trump by double digits. with nearly all precincts reporting,trump carried a nearly insurmountable 134,000 vote lead – 1.4 percentage points -- leaving democrats crushed and trump’s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn’t come. he held vote leads of 144,000 in naples-fort myers market, 126,000 in the pensacola market, 83,000 in the panama city market and 58,000 in the orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the i-4 corridor. trump began election day down by at least 57,000 votes to clinton, according to results posted on the florida division of elections website just after the last florida polls closed at 7 p.m. central time. trump’s strength was no surprise to republican party of florida chairman blaise ingoglia, who earlier in the day said republicans had more energized voters who couldn’t wait until election day to cast ballots. instead, trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of florida – his second home where he owns the palm beach mar-a-lago estate – and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment’s notice in florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously. by tuesday morning, democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on election day. she won a stunning 571,000 more votes than trump in the miami-fort lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. one of trump’s pollsters, tony fabrizio, said the results showed that clinton exceeded president obama’s margins in the florida markets he won in 2012. trump ran up huge margins with white florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. "this was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn’t measure," said one republican pollster who was surprised by trump’s numbers. new: how trump won florida with more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, donald trump carried a 140,000 vote lead in florida. but not fast enough for the liking of democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how trump had lost florida and therefore the white house. though obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state. trump’s campaign initially didn’t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. in early october, as hurricane matthew left part of the state damaged, wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. now democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while republicans keep voting. the spending was noteworthy because trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on tv and get-out-the-vote "ground game" efforts. clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into election day, energized by early vote results that showed hispanic turnout exploding. sen. nelson’s team fears a showdown with scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message. "the difference here is that trump did far better than mitt romney did in almost every county on election day," fabrizio said. trump’s positions put him at loggerheads with the spanish-language powerhouse network, univision, which has studios in the same city as his doral golf club. you could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible," said curt anderson, top adviser to gov. the size of the vote was historic in populous democratic strongholds like broward, miami-dade and palm beach counties. their outsized support counteracted the votes of hispanics and blacks – 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively. black and hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls. her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day "tense and nerve wracking." she won three lesser markets: west palm (a 44,000-vote lead); gainesville (10,000 more votes) and tallahassee (11,000 more votes). trump blew away records in the tampa bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted i-4 corridor that helps swing elections. but even with all of the new trump spending, hillary clinton’s campaign began to surge. "by 5 p.m., our voters showed again," the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. and poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked trump. | getty how trump won florida trump's florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide. see you nov 8th," univision pundit jorge ramos wrote june 3 on twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim – proven wrong in this instance by trump – about the power of the hispanic vote. maga!," susie wiles, trump’s florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his "make america great again" slogan. maybe he’ll win because of what’s in the countryside, so to speak, or the panhandle. exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way. but while clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward trump. trump’s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him florida. often the hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young hispanics, they’ll be voting for hillary." about 1 p.m., one source with clinton’s campaign said, the democrats were worried. and whites are still a majority of florida’s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. the florida meltdown is a familiar story for democrats still scarred by al gore’s 2000 loss to george w. bush in a razor close race. in the counties composing the market, trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over clinton. republicans were crushing the vote in the panhandle, southwest florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties. most major surveys also showed trump losing the state – including exit polls on election day. florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. "my theory is that no one can make it to the wh without the latino vote. latino turnout in miami-dade and orange county was just not enough for clinton. but the vaunted obama machine in florida was no machine without obama on the ticket. "trump didn’t run a robust program in south florida targeting the hispanic community. "we had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn’t," ingoglia said. nelson and other democrats also expected clinton to pad her margin with african-american support. clinton’s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. in the jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. scott won, he did so because he really reached out. "so goes florida, so goes the country," said florida’s senior senator, bill nelson. "but ultimately, this is a message to the establishment. if trump had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. and he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration. he delayed advertising on television – a must for any other statewide candidate. "the trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. but obama only carried florida by less than a point. but turnout was even higher in republican areas. she sounded the alarm and trump made sure the money was reprogrammed. and they vote in even greater numbers. but this is really doing it the hard way." story continued below "i am so proud of this team! rick scott’s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts. well, they showed up on election day." he would have florida in the bag. in myriad ways, trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom. "look at the hispanics turning out. it started to trend down. scott, the chair of the pro-trump super pac. it seems @realdonaldtrump has a different theory. it’s an anti-establishment year." wiles, who managed gov. "but when gov. "we felt pretty good."
sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country’s existing social services, britain’s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, finland may implement a version of ubi next year, and a city in the netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment . some on the political left have supported ubi a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people’s quality of life, while some on the right have seen it as a way to make the existing welfare state more efficient while promoting individual choice and reducing "welfare traps." while it’s far from mainstream acceptance, ubi is viewed by some as a means to provide workers with economic stability as an increasing amount of the world’s labor is automated. another concern is whether providing a basic income is the best way to spend public funds that could be specifically targeted to certain groups in need, the model most welfare programs currently follow. sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most ubi proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money — minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. a recent oxford university study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%). "i think we are moving towards a world with less job security," says matthew krisiloff, who is managing y combinator’s ubi study. in its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year. "there’s political consensus around it, and there’s relative simplicity in the sense that it’s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want." a recent however, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. "i think part of the reason it’s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs," he says. rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. limits aside, the general point remains the same: (almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions. y combinator’s krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. why this tech company is giving 100 people free money the firm is about to give about 100 people between $1,500 and $2,000 every month to spend on whatever they please. however, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. the program, to be carried out in nearby oakland, is meant to test a scheme called universal basic income, or ubi. "people are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help." many worry that a basic income could reduce the incentive to work, slowing the economy. meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. no nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. despite sporadic support on both sides of the aisle, ubi has historically remained on the policy fringes. here’s what you should know about ubi: what is universal basic income? the basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . in reality, it gets a little more complicated. why is it popular? is anyone getting paid yet?
the global gender gap report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas: 1. in a year that has brought us national conversations about working women, leaning in and whether or not the patriarchy is in fact "dead," you might expect that all this talk signaled a real improvement for gender equality in the united states. this year the united states ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the u.s. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373. as always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the u.s. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done. but the u.s. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. where the u.s. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. in fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the u.s. according to the 2013 global gender gap report released on oct. 24 by the world economic forum, that, unfortunately, is not the case. and though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the u.s. ranked 6th for economic participation.

and don’t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we’re too "time poor" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. if the untouched remnants of last week’s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. ideally, from a supermarket pr point of view, the term "food poverty" would appear in every headline that contains "supermarket food waste", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. but sell-by dates – the progenitor of use by and best before – were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning. what’s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system. once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning four decades on, it’s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. there aren’t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in british households before the supermarket era, but i’d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now. on the day that his chain’s depressing results were published, chief executive dave lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain. probably wisely, the others don’t publish their waste figures, but let’s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we’d already know all about it. the bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin. just in case you aren’t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. there you have the dramatis personae in tesco’s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a "must work harder" rating, and enlightened tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste. they encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we’ll consume, rather than focusing on what’s in our fridges and larders day-to-day. our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. they promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. if we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain. battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. crumbs from the rich man’s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can’t afford to eat good, fresh food. when the supermarkets began colonising the uk grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms. if you’re finding that figure hard to envisage, it’s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. so supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. tesco’s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but pr executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way tesco deflected criticism. who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less? this precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. from this we can deduce that tesco’s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. "while the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example." theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. after deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. but is tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? they are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that’s riddled with problems. far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it. it places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities. l ast year, ast year, tesco’s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . [th guardian] we shoppers aren’t to blame for food waste. nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. but a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. one such glaring issue is food waste. just press the same-as-last-week option. guess who is. better safe than sorry, surely? why?
for a company like nintendo that was in real need of huge hits to shake things up, the one-two punch of pokemon go and the nes classic edition this year couldn’t have arrived at a more opportune time. not only does it give you serious bang for the buck by including 30 popular nintendo games for a suggested retail price of just $60, but it allows people to stop using emulators or figuring out ways to get their original console to work with today’s tv tech. we’ll keep you posted and update as soon as we know when that might be, as this is one retro system you’re going to want to jump on fast. it’s going to be difficult to keep in stock, especially when you factor in nintendo’s rather ... checkered past when it comes to its ability to ratchet up supply to meet demand. in other words, if you think you’ll be able to roll into a store on november 11 and just pick one up, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. not many video game hardware projects are absolute no-brainers, but the mini nes classic edition — officially going by the unwieldy name nintendo entertainment system: nes classic edition — checks off all the boxes. that’s a good one to bookmark, though, as the online retailer is a good bet to allow pre-orders as soon as humanly possible. the answer, of course, is to pre-order one, or maybe more than one considering how hot these are going to be. considering how popular nintendo’s little blast from the past is likely to be, this is a pretty important question. indeed, a glance at the indeed, a glance at the page amazon has set aside for the product simply gives you the depressing "currently unavailable" message. the nes classic edition is likely to be a victim of its own popularity. unfortunately, the nes classic edition is not available for pre-order just yet. your other go-to places, like gamestop, target, and the like, are almost certainly going to follow suit. but there’s a problem, or rather, there’s going to be a problem. is the nes classic edition available for pre-order? even people who don’t normally consider themselves gamers are anxious for it to arrive.

"the textbooks market is broken and students are paying the price," ethan senack, a higher-education associate at us pirg, told us news & world report in 2014. one of the biggest ways college students are ripped off is getting out of control college affordability has recently become the preeminent issue in higher education, as student-debt figures have hit staggering levels. the us public interest research group (us pirg) conducted a survey of 156 different college campuses across 33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a book required for class due to its high cost. and the high prices are beginning to discourage some students from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact that they realize it may hurt their grades. they can, however, mitigate the rising cost of textbooks by looking for alternatives, such as buying used books and selling their books after the course has come to an end. since 1977, the price of college textbooks has more than tripled the rate of inflation, meaning a 1,041% rise, according to nbc news, which cites bureau of labor statistics data. "[students] can't shop around and find the most affordable option, meaning there's no consumer control on the market," senack said. some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole dollars. they have to buy whatever books they're assigned," nicole allen, a spokeswoman for the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition, told nbc. but most conversations center on ballooning tuition costs, rather than a less well-known expense that strains the wallets of college students: textbooks. and 94% of those students acknowledged that they were afraid that the move would hurt their grade. still, students and experts following the trend say that the prices are becoming prohibitively expensive. "they've been able to keep raising prices because students are 'captive consumers.'
you'll never guess what nick jonas does in the shower when we go to the gym, we listen to nick jonas. we caught up with the singer at the new york city launch event for his new collaboration with audio brand altec lansing on thursday, and we asked him to spill all the details of his listening preferences—starting with his go-to workout mix. jonas explained that while he listens to "a bunch of different things" at the gym, he keeps them all organized in one spot. much to our surprise, the singer revealed that while in the shower, he belts out a few of his favorite broadway tunes. "on my artist page on spotify, i have a playlist that’s all of my favorite songs," said jonas. "it’s all over the place, and i kind of just post on that." but when his gym sesh is over, jonas hits a very different note. "i pretty much do all of les mis as a one-man show," he said. when we do pretty much anything, we listen to nick jonas. but what does nick jonas listen to while tackling those very same daily tasks? when we take a shower, we listen to nick jonas. the exercise-ready soundtrack is called "hot jams," and it features "everything from kanye and drake to fleetwood mac," said jonas. "'the soliloquy,' and the confrontation between valjean and javert is also pretty good." and the best part is, you can shuffle through them yourself. "so that’s what i put on." now that’s a visual we can appreciate. well, you’re about to find out. his faves?
he explained that he doesn’t feel uncomfortable doing nothing, if nothing has captured his interest - and it’s better to do nothing than waste time trying not to waste time. the secret to being successful is a lot easier than you think if you’re reading this in bed after a lie-in don’t worry. lewis said he doesn’t see laziness as a trait to avoid, because it focuses his efforts on the things that matter. this is coming from the man who’s written six books in the last ten years, while also working as an editor at vanity fair – so his advice may be worth listening to. laziness, he said, stops you from wasting time on things that aren’t worth your time. if you mistake busyness for importance, which we do a lot, you're not able to see what really is important. michael lewis, author of the big short, told the audience of the insight summit that being lazy isn’t necessarily a bad thing. he said: people waste years of their lives not being willing to waste hours of their lives. something has to be really good before i'll decide to work on it. laziness might not be a terrible trait after all. if you can be  bothered, that is. in fact, it can make you more successful. my laziness serves as a filter.

how stephen hawking has lived so long with als an expert on lou gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how hawking has beaten the odds editor’s note: renowned theoretical physicist stephen hawking died on march 14, 2018, at age 76. it's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. we spoke with leo mccluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the als center at the university of pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared hawking and his amazing brain. most patients with als—also known as lou gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. if he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. it's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. for much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). this story, originally published on his 70th birthday on january 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). how much do you think stephen hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of als? these are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. als, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as lou gehrig's disease in the u.s.—is a neurodegenerative disease. i'm sure there are also at-risk genes for als, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, als was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. the guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. one thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. however, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons. but that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time. one of the misconceptions about als is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true. and the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. if you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. he's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur. why has hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and i don't know enough about his course to say. each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. the other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type? each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday. i have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. there is also primary lateral sclerosis—pls—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. and since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care. but it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. and it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? i just know him from television, so i don't know what kind of interventions he's had. the disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both. the famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. what have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments? stephen hawking turns 70 on sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. but not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say. it's been known for quite some time that there are variants of als. knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. for trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. so some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia. what does stephen hawking's case mean for people who have the disease? and he is currently the director of research at the school's center for theoretical cosmology. what is als—and is there more than one form of it? it appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. how frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of als? hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge. but like his mind, hawking's illness seems to be singular. but his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens. however, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder. those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. it's now clear that that's not true. what has stephen hawking's case shown about the disease? or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference? but mostly it's about the biology of the disease. on average people live two to three years after diagnosis. ten percent of als is genetic and based on a gene mutation. i would say probably less than a few percent. it's probably a little bit of both. what's happened to him is just astounding. so the common way people die is of respiratory failure. but none of this has given us any robust therapies yet. but it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles. one is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or pma. i don't believe that adds to longevity. als still doesn't have a cure. he's certainly an outlier.
although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named "yinmn blue." he added: "then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while i was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light. subramanian told artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. this burst of blue came about when scientists at oregon state university (osu) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200°c (2,000°f). the paint manufacturers shepherd color company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of yinmn blue. additionally, unlike prussian blue or cobalt blue pigments, it doesn’t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic – that's always a plus. after being heralded as "the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment," this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists’ brushes. he added: "our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable." "basically, this was an accidental discovery," said mas subramanian, a milton harris professor of materials science in the osu department of chemistry, in a statement. the findings of the original study were published in the journal of the american chemical society. back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance. scientists accidentally discover a new color, and it's beautiful! "our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment. this pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. so, what’s so special about this blue? [h/t: mental floss] [h/t: mental floss] [h/t: mental floss] i realized immediately that something amazing had happened."
research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light: a study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group. being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age. a study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. blocking this color light may help you sleep better the disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well documented, and have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years -- with good reason. rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark. daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes. but you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. you don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. in a study by scientists at quebec's universite laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. in particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. this area of research is critically important, and i expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. but there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you: limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. while nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. scientists at china's sichuan university studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. in addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease. the study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. the last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources. cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether. a new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. they found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures: patients were sleeping more during the night. cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. at the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency. shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. these subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night. if you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. the study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. if you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. the number of subjects who met the criteria for "poor sleepers" had decreased. unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished. lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. their sleep quality had improved. get light exposure during the day. reading under moderate lamplight is fine.
it is the second 'spoon' to be found on mars in recent years, with alien hunters claiming it could be proof of developed life on the planet. forget whether or not there is water on mars - if this photo is to be believed, there is fresh beer on the red planet's surface. on the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on mars' spotted by one of the viking orbiters in 1976. vigilante mars 'anomaly hunter' thomas miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through curiosity's latest snaps of the red planet. in december last year, nasa's curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planet's surface. an eagle-eyed mars 'anomaly hunter' has spotted a strange object that looks like a green bottle in nasa rover imagery. the curiosity video was uploaded to youtube by ufo hunter account 'secure team' with the description: 'there is a giant spoon on mars! 'this find is exceptionally clear; the design of the bottle is a bit different but recognisable,' mr miller, a canadian musician, told mailonline. the pictures were taken by nasa's spirit rover during a mission on the surface of mars in november 2007. given the thousands of images of mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual,' he told mailonline. 'of course there's no way to know for sure it's a beer bottle, i'm going out on limb calling it that. 'if someday we visit their planet it would be nice to think we could sit down and have a beer with them.' 'i think they are looking for anything out of the ordinary, and our minds like to see patterns in things. the bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end. the anomaly hunter found the bottle while browsing through panoramas of nasa images stitched together by other mars enthusiasts. 'usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light.' but nigel watson, an alien expert and author of the ufo investigations manual, is sceptical of the bottle find. scroll down for video  pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. and some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: 'wow, it couldn't possibly be natural, could it?' there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. the strange bottle shape is not the first oddity to be spotted on mars. other objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years. some folk see the face of jesus in tea-leaves, others see the man in the moon.' 'i think it is evidence of current habitation on mars,' he told mailonline. it is a form of apophenia, when people see patterns in random, unconnected data. i tend to see artifacts on the martian surface as part art gallery and part garbage dump.' 'we find trash, tools, machine parts, bits of paper, as well as sculpture and carved stone tablets. is this image proof of beer on mars? however, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion. one user commented: 'we see what we want to see. this was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes. this thing is amazing! probably left over from a lost civilisation.'
only seven episodes into season 5, kristina is collapsing into happy tears at the podium as she campaigns for mayor, amber and sarah are scream-crying over wedding plans and julia is an emotional wreck. the saddest/happiest show on tv is... last season on "parenthood," viewers went on an emotional rollercoaster when kristina braverman was diagnosed with breast cancer. and whether our tears are sad or happy, we're crying right along with the bravermans. a year later, kristina is officially cancer-free, but somehow the tears just keep coming.
here's why summer in new york city smells so awful for travelers with the gleam of the big apple in their eye, nothing seems better than new york city in the summertime. new york city has the highest population density in the us, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation’s melting pot, it’s bound to get smelly. to many, new york is the city of dreams, but you have to be willing to accept it for the good, the bad, and the smelly. but even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day. garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the hudson river to be incinerated in new jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas. with such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced. although residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, new york city doesn’t have any of its own landfills or incinerators. let this sink in: that’s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and that's just for one city. here's why it's hard to escape the stench of the city in the heat of summer. there also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city. all this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues. you may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day. it turns out the combination of heat and humidity allow bacteria to grow faster and smells to travel further. a census conducted in july 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile. but long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office. or how it is possible to smell a food cart from all the way down the street. restaurants have outdoor seating, there are festivals all over town, and you don't have to worry about bringing your jacket to top of the rock. so when you get stuck with one those incredibly humid days, smells become only more potent. the water in the air causes these odors to dissolve, trapping them longer than if it were a dry day outside. to put that into perspective, the us, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile. the sheer amount of garbage isn’t the only problem. that much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away. diesel trucks carry garbage out of manhattan 7.8 million times each year. increasing temps mean molecules move faster, resulting in enzymes speeding up metabolism and cells quickly increasing in size. heat is bacteria’s best friend.
"i'd been going through some stuff in my personal life, maxine said, "and i was kind of having a sad day, so i...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand." but the story of isis only underscored the worry of rodney jones, the chief of kanawha’s park police department... people like james butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals—potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection. and once james shared his pictures online, officer jones feared it would become the subject of the public's curious cameras... "now that the albino’s getting publicity," rodney said, "i figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park." "she spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...i just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness." james was strolling through coonskin park, a riverside sliver of nature located in kanawha county, west virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. as to how they got stuck, james said, "the dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn’t reach the top to get back out." the albino raccoon had been "a well-kept secret" in coonskin park, according to rodney jones, chief of kanawha's park police department. james had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way. for a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! five raccoons were trapped inside the coonskin park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before. such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in georgia... for part of her early life, isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. when maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. "since she was described as so aggressive," maxine said, "we were just going to hold her for a couple of days." the georgia department of natural resources rescued isis and delivered the raccoon to maxine rainey, below, director of the georgia animal sanctuary, a new hope. she sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should've been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. retired west virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast james butler heard strange cries coming from a charleston, west virginia, dumpster on tuesday, august 11, 2015. because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. "i'd really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone’s curiosity or stupidity." he didn't really look like like his family members—or like any raccoon james had ever seen! he leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! "we try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don’t try to feed them," he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. stunned by his find, james didn't forget the real trouble at hand—these raccoons were stuck. chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. but both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause... investigating strange cries emanating from a west virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie. the organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. and people searching for a wild animal—with a wild animal's instincts—can be trouble. curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera... worse, the albino raccoon's appearance can make it a "prize" in the eyes of some people. this trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the indiana division of fish and wildlife. thinking quickly, james fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. hopefully others lucky enough to spot one of these beautiful beasts in nature take the same approach! he heard something moving inside this dumpster... what he found inside? human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. from there, the raccoon's life only got better. maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal. something special that needs to be captured or owned. luckily, there was good news in store for her... curious, he investigated the sounds. they're to be admired from afar! "she's so gentle," maxine said. but james butler might disagree with you there. they were free—but that brought consequences. no wonder she was aggressive. but amazingly, that didn't happen. and that rare raccoon? understandably, isis was aggressive. right away, he noticed two things. but then what? how rare, exactly? astonishing!
popular country singer's tour bus strikes and kills pedestrian country crooner jason aldean has found himself in unfortunate circumstances after a tour bus carrying the "dirt road anthem" singer ran over a pedestrian early monday morning in knox county, indiana. abc news confirmed the tragedy with the knox county sheriff's department, and also cited the police report that claimed "the individual deceased from trauma to the head and chest." "with a heavy heart, i'm sad to say that a man passed away last night after stepping out in front of my bus in indiana. multiple publications report that albert kennedy of vincennes, ind., was crossing the street at 1:28 a.m., when the tour bus struck and killed him. i'm praying for albert kennedy's family and friends today and ask that you do the same," he wrote. in all the years i've been touring and all the miles we've driven, nothing prepares you for something like this to happen. aldean, 36, took to his whosay account to express his condolences to the victim's family.

"eventually, he called up jk and asked if he could say ‘harry put it in his pocket’ instead. years later, he was doing his job as normal when, reading the prisoner of azkaban, he came across a part where the titular character pockets something. "good for you," he apparently told her, not realising that harry potter would go on to be the worldwide cultural phenomenon it is today. "the phrase ‘harry pocketed it’ appeared in the next four books." seriously, she can be dastardly to anyone who gets in her way. she thought for a moment, then said ‘no’, and hung up. perhaps jk rowling really does belong in slytherin?
here is a time table showing a small sample of the time i allotted for certain tasks: some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch—like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die—but for most of them, you have to travel. you could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the trinity church on king george island in antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. i decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane. i also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip—around 40 hours in total—and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that. some stops later, i'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in europe, stopping in estonia to see the beech tree in hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to finland to go to the kontula indoor skatepark in helsinki. so i decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the buzzfeed tasks. if you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the mendenhall ice caves in juneau, alaska, to find that they have all melted. i really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, i suppose luxuriating in the rem cycle shouldn't be a priority. we calculated how long it would take to do everything buzzfeed tells you to do before you die it's hard to look at buzzfeed without being reminded of your mortality. i whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. some of the lists, like the five highest places to visit before you die, require you to jet-set from the haiku stairs of oahu, hawaii to the petronas towers of kuala lumpur, malaysia, to the taihang mountains in china. if you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but i'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. i'd make my way over to turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the pamukkale springs in hierapolis and then pop over to jordan to grab a drink at the cave bar in petra. if someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this earth has to offer, i'd be hard pressed to say no. and as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, buzzfeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can. but if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it. and what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? the site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. i mean, i'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? this is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. on motherboard: counting the hours i've spent on the internet next, i calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. i figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so i allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. in conclusion—drumroll, please—i determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that buzzfeed says you need to do before you die. other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the camino de santiago, otherwise known as st. james' path, between spain and france, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. here's how i did it: first, i had to compile all of the lists buzzfeed has published in its "before you die" format. buzzfeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing aussie burgers or the ten best new orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in london. could you actually check everything off the buzzfeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? these ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to south africa's version of burning man). in order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. there are a lot of things on that list that i, personally, have no interest in doing. in total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries. if you're as young and bored as i am, though, you might wonder: could you pull it off? i settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks. would i really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world? according to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. i decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in boston, where i live, and work my way west through north america. is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? i would visit 36 states in the united states and stop in canada and mexico along the way. eating fish and chips, for example—how long does that take the average person? i repeated this process for every single task on buzzfeed's lists. i'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. next, i cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. then onto the dominican republic to explore the three shipwrecks of bayahibe, followed by stops at turks and caicos, and belize. at the time i filed this story, there were 182 lists. a little while ago, i set out to find out for myself. i'm not saying i wouldn't do it. that said, i'm not sure why anyone would want to. again, there are over a thousand individual tasks. there are over a thousand individual tasks. the last thing i calculated was sleep time. of course, i'll probably die before that happens. that's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years. why should i visit 39 different christmas markets across europe? buzzfeed has a handy quiz for that, too. the trail is nearly 500 miles long.
all that stuff like i said, i just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like i said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen—how i get ready for the offseason, how i get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that. when you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the rams twice a year, you go against the arizona cardinals twice a year, that’s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week. i’m just grateful i get to take the god-given ability that god has given me and just spread it across to my teammates and for us to play together and try to hopefully win another super bowl, and that’s kind of my singular focus. that’s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens. with the seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the chiefs, we had a chance to chat with wilson about a recent commercial he shot with bose for their quietcomfort35 headphones. i think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well. from third-round pick out of college to a couple super bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league—so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself? over the phone, the three-time pro bowler and super xlviii champion talked about his unusual—at least for your average nfl player’s standards—taste in music, the future of the seattle seahawks, and how married life is treating him. i have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we’re watching film, all those things, so i’m constantly just listening to music. i listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, ciara and i, but also on the field, too. i think ultimately the nfl and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is. those guys are gonna do a great job, and we’re looking forward to having a great season. not only does he have two super bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with ciara. russell wilson refuses to listen to drake before games russell wilson is just about one of the most humble people you could ever meet. are you concerned the legion of boom won’t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them? our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams—you take it one day at a time. you’ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the nfl is trying to do? i try to be calm as can be and just grateful that i can play the game. she’s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. the nfl said they’re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren’t 100 percent sure. i think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise. he’s like tim tebow, but wilson doesn’t look like he’s going back to baseball any time soon. where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year? they’re very first class in everything they do, and i’m a big music person, as you know. so we’re looking forward to him being back out there on the field. you have one song to listen to before kickoff, what’re you listening to? i’m excited about all the things that they’re gonna do this year. all i care about is our team winning; that’s the only thing that matters. what’s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason? i’m not giving away too much, i want people to see it first. kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the nfc west. at age 27 there is definitely more to come for the seattle seahawks quarterback. i’m just grateful i get to play the game of football. you guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. in the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs. so you’re not listening to drake, eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff? we have a great team, we have a lot of great players. i’m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in. kinda can’t tell too much, but it was a great commercial. i think the legion of boom is going to be great once again. how much did marshawn lynch mean to this team and your play? i think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. i just like focusing on the things i need to focus on. there was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got jimmy graham last year. what did you make of the hall of fame game being canceled? before a game, i’m always listening to gospel music. awh man, i don’t pay attention to any of that stuff. i’m grateful that god has given me that opportunity. he’s always gonna be well respected across the league. it’s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. it’s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with bose. i’m just so grateful on game day. so what is this bose commercial looking like? it’s a special, special day, those days. i don’t try to be all amped up. unfortunately, he didn’t get to play the whole season. now, guys gotta step up, and we can’t wait. he’s gonna do a great job. that’s not for me to worry about. it always comes down to players’ safety. you were ranked 17th in the nfl top 100. congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life? so i’m just grateful, man. that’s probably my go-to song. it’s gonna be a good commercial. that’s my only focus, man. i’m just grateful for that. marshawn’s a great football player. that’s the simplicity of it. "i’m gonna be ready" by yolanda adams . that’s a great question. it’s not that complicated. so many talented players, so many talented teams. how come his numbers went down? nah, i’m chillin’ out. your celebrity has reached new heights. the rest will handle itself.
we should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with your social security or how to fix your city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in your body. i invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the "-augh" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project. i mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? watch kids "clean" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the "trash" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for. and if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it? i mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase expo markers in bulk or boxes of kleenex that should be supplied already? get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes on them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo. i’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) i can afford more than that. supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at target during a grocery run. and yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use. why i won't buy one extra box of kleenex for my kid's school supplies so we started doing the school supply shopping this week. we act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. i guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how. and yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. if you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. i’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive "just this size" binder. well, then, haven’t i done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. the supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. and if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. i put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? you think you have to buy too many glue sticks? multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. who thinks it should be my job to bring ziploc bags to school? but i sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. a daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. the kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. and *gasp* what if someone other than my precious timmy uses them? aren’t they the ones doing us the favor? so, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. kids don’t learn as well then. and let’s talk about that list, shall we? pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. especially when those might not get used by my kids? buy the extra box of tissues. markers find new homes in backpacks. be frustrated with me for the right reasons. i’m frustrated by our entitlement. now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. yes, expo markers are expensive. umm, let’s back up a minute. yes, i’m frustrated. more is more, right? so, let’s fast forward to january. well, i’ll tell you who. and forget the $10. and then what happens? let’s see. and guess what? was it 20? maybe sad, but still true. (insert sarcastic eye roll here). this mom. oh no. 30?
you won't believe why espn said they hired jordan rodgers august 8, 2016 | 1:22pm the former vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the sec network as a college football analyst this season, and an espn executive says rodgers earned the role on his talent alone. "i’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for espn and doing some tv stuff here and there — and i’ll be working with espn and sec network as a college football analyst," rodgers said. "i had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line," druley said. his name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to charlotte [where the sec network is located] for auditions," senior v.p. druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though abc and espn are both owned by disney. the audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air," she said. after rodgers emerged as a front-runner on "the bachelorette," espn made him an offer a few weeks into the season. "he accepted the offer the day i was in an airport and saw us weekly with him splashed across the cover. "it was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones i read." rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. when aaron rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew druley away. "that’s the conference i played in. "our talent office had jordan on their radar for some time. rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week. we had seen some interviews that he had done. "he played at vanderbilt. that’s kind of my knowledge base." so we reached out to him." he played quarterback. stephanie druley told si.com .
how free dlc helped turn a small steam game into a hit keeping dlc mostly free has keeping dlc mostly free has worked well for big developers like cd projekt with the witcher 3 , who can garner reams of publicity from players used to being nickled-and-dimed to death by other big-budget releases. they recently published a blog post about how that’s gone for them as it turns out, the as it turns out, the first free dlc —which included 70 new events, a new main quest line, new building types, new voice acting, an event editor, and a bunch of smaller features—didn’t up sales enough to justify tearing off the price tag. they recently published in the wake of a more successful than expected launched (the game recouped costs within a day of release), its developers decided its major dlc packs would be free. in the wake of a more successful than expected launched (the game recouped costs within a day of release), its developers decided its major dlc packs would be free. "working with a publisher was a huge saving grace here, as we did not carry the costs of the localization which the publisher invested in, to eventually regain from the box sales. our sales this month had a +1572% increase from the previous month on steam, and while the sale is likely the main culprit here, we still think combining the two was the jackpot." "if like us, you have a small team, limited resources and a tight budget that simply cannot stretch to huge marketing campaigns, you need to think outside the box. it’s more of they’ve since released another piece of dlc that’s, well, not really dlc at all. thea: the awakening is a turn-based 4x strategic survival game inspired by slavic mythology that came out late last year. create a good product, respect your client and the rest will fall into place—sounds idealistic, but it certainly worked for us and i am sure it can work for you." "the dlc was free and about 8,000 of our players have enjoyed it within the first two weeks after the release. we stuck to our deadlines, used a faster service to do our shortened localization, and we released the multiprayer dlc during the steam summer sale. is a turn-based 4x strategic survival game inspired by slavic mythology that came out late last year. "people began to create forum threads encouraging others to buy thea for their friends," the developers wrote, "organised their own giveaways and even doing their own community translations." free dlc can be good for players and developers, but developers have to be strategic about it. sales after the dlc brought about 10,000 euro above what we were usually selling without the dlc, and normalized in about 10 days." "the cost of development of this dlc ended up being around 90,000 euro," thea ’s developer wrote. they’ve since released another piece of dlc that’s, well, not really dlc at all. this one added multiplayer, and they decided to release it close to the steam summer sale, to drum up additional interest. you probably have heard of it, but folks who like it really, really like it. still, for us, the giants did not prove to be a huge financial hit and it was disheartening." for us, this meant putting a lot of emphasis on our community in hopes of the power of the ‘word of mouth’. for their for their second major free dlc , they decided to take a more tactical approach. sponsored "so if we were to judge things by those figures alone, we would have lost a big chunk of cash," they added. they explained: "i mentioned earlier how timing was an issue for giants, and i believe we have learnt our lesson. this strategy has paid off and we do believe it is a valid route for other indies. in the meantime, they saw players recommending the game, mentioning substantial free dlc as a big plus. you probably have heard of it, but folks who like itreally, reallylike it. it was made by four people with a bit of aid from a publishing partner. despite that, they decided to stick with their free dlc plan. it’s more of a glorified donate button that grants players some snazzy cards. "the indie market is a tough one," they wrote. the thea team’s takeaway from all of this? what happens, though, when a steam indie takes a similar approach? it’s currently got 1,053 reviews on steam, of which 90 percent are positive. game-changing dlc, it seems, will remain free. sounds like it worked. some even went a step further.
mad men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do contrast that to today, when a show like the americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as mad men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. mad men also benefitted from the rise of tv recapping in general thus, there was a huge opening in the "reading about tv on the internet" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and mad men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by sopranos at the golden globes and the emmys. this is why the media can’t stop writing about mad men one of the most consistent criticisms of mad men from those who aren't mad men fans is that — sniffs derisively — it's only beloved by the coastal media elite, because it's about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising. the mad men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle this has carried right over to vox. 3) there just wasn't as much good tv on when mad men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of the sopranos, the cancellation of hbo's deadwood, and the impending end of the wire signaled the end of tv's golden age. but the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of mad men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of ncis. but, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, the a.v. 4) mad men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done though it never pulled in big bang theory numbers, amc told vulture's joe adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. the mad men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle. this most recent season of that fx drama received the kind of acclaim mad men did in its heyday — but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. that number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller. that strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the amc drama's series finale, with vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author michael idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. we write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour mad men content — far beyond any other show i've written about here that's not game of thrones. lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations the sopranos invited. 2) mad men debuted right after the sopranos ended and filled the void the show left when mad men began, in the summer of 2007, the sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of americans are actually watching, shows like the big bang theory and ncis and even empire. but by season two, the awards and critical attention mad men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. that number would explode in years to come — and mad men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write tv recaps and people who wanted to read them. but tv sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as mad men did. yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but mad men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it. 5) never underestimate passion as my colleague matthew yglesias wrote about the popularity of bernie sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. mad men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do. the show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up. early on, the media positioned mad men as a sort of lifestyle choice the media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. the first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when dvrs and streaming services were less prevalent. alan sepinwall began his seminal blog what's alan watching in late 2005, and by that final sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch mad men. thus, it was easy to get the "serious tv" audience to tune in to mad men, because there weren't a ton of other options. instead, mad men and later breaking bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while fx entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day. 1) readers wanted to read about it in my pre-vox life, i was the tv editor of the a.v. the answer to why the media keeps pushing mad men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us. back when the series debuted, the media wrote about mad men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in idov's words, shoving mad men down readers' throats. but it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. the wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. what holds true for sanders is also true for mad men: there are very few casual mad men fans. club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of tv content readers wanted to consume. but mad men also benefited from the rise of tv recapping in general. they were essentially limited to the wire, dexter, lost, heroes, 24, grey's anatomy, and maybe veronica mars (if your readership was especially young). and those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show. i agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of mad men. (to support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in russia.) and every time we wrote about mad men, those numbers spiked. the two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters. some of that was an accident of timing. to some degree, this is true. here are five. i've tried.)

a meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and ldl cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil. a review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised ldl (a type of ldl), with no significant effects on total or ldl cholesterol. in contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat). avoid junk food  in our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols. in a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks. in a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for ldl. after 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls. one caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kj), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day. plant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver. here are 5 foods to eat and avoid high fat, low fat, no carb, more carb: when it comes to getting information on eating to manage high blood cholesterol, confusion reigns. more than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice. a big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the health professionals follow-up study and 51, 000 women from the nurses' health study (1986-2010). eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads  plant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts. the results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together. this is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans. but the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods. those who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk. the most recent australian health survey found fewer than one in five australians ate them on the day of the survey. when it comes to heart disease risk factors, get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked next time you see your gp. a review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in ldl cholesterol. researchers found total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil. eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol. use olive oil  olive oil is a major component of the mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. eat nuts  nuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary. they are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk. it didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction. the soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel. we checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol. eat legumes  legumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels. the data showed ldl cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day. the reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. this 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood. people with higher ldl cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement. after four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'. the type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important. you can check your diet quality using our healthy eating quiz. they lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure. this means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal. switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol. legumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called ldl). over a third of australian adults have high cholesterol. they lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways. olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat. if you don't, ask your gp to check it. pulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. do you know your blood cholesterol level? do you have high cholesterol? eating less lowers it. the benefits of making these changes? the bad news? 1. good news first! 5. 2. 4. 3. the verdict?
the sales taxes, like the one in pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax. i cant even afford to pay tax on a bagel how do you think im gonna pay for this — not ricky (@ricky_tran_) august 2, 2016 when and how to tax consumers buying services and goods from internet companies has long been a difficult question to answer. though it's called the netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. netflix even battled in kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax. the state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like netflix and hulu. one bill to charge online sales take, the marketplace fairness act, has been debated for years and remains up for debate. amazon avoided charging sales tax for years before starting to charge it in some locations. so if you want to avoid the netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. at least until the netflix tax comes for us all, that is. chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its "cloud tax." similar taxes have come up in canada. pennsylvania is taxing netflix spotify and apple music. digital goods are also taxable in minnesota. digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the bible, will be exempt. amazon now collects sales tax in 28 states. watch out: the "netflix tax" is coming. the 'netflix tax' is starting...but where? at least in pennsylvania.
the press release that was given fromlocated in schleswig-holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. wadden sea national park located in schleswig-holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. clearly, with this much debris in a whales stomach, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. you won't believe what killed them as of january 29th, just on the shores around the north sea, sperm whales were found stranded in the shallow area that is not meant for marine wildlife. i n addition to this statement, nicola hodgkins who is affiliated with whale and dolphin conservation states: "although the large pieces will cause obvious problems and block the gut, we shouldn't dismiss the smaller bits that could cause a more chronic problem for all species of cetacean – not just those who suction feed." clearly, with this much debris in a, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. people on the other hand, however, believe that this is what happens when humanity continues to disregard marine life as well as the overabundance of plastic that is now circulating all over our oceans. this was a consequence of them mistakenly swimming into the north sea, most likely in search of squid, but then not being able to support the weight of their own body's in such shallow water. some people suggest that this is due to the whales thinking that the plastic items were food, like squid since that is a whales go to staple. however, the details of the animals' necropsy that was released shows a very gruesome truth as to how the whales dyed to begin with. it is very important thing to note that the young whales did not die due to the plastic in their stomachs. animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs." even that being the truth, humanity still needs to address this situation as a major warning sign about how much pollution we are pouring into our oceans. having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish. environment minister for the state of schleswig-holstein, robert habeck states: "these findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. these animals could have had longer lives without mistakenly consuming the extreme amounts of debris we keep giving our planet. do not dismiss their deaths as if it were meant to be, because it certainly wasn't. scientists were very concerned and deeply disturbed as to what they found inside the unfortunate whales. in fact, according to national geographic, the whales had died due to heart failure. end this horrible trend of pollution, help us turn the tides and clean our planet! as an unfortunate result, the whales internal organs had collapsed. giant whales found dead in germany.
livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two. "maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s," livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. but not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent pew survey about marriage, livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others. "the older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried," livingston said. younger americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. livingston analyzed data from the 2013 american community survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the us has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. while only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013. if you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy. for one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, "eligible" to remarry has also risen. livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts. when pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. another interesting finding combined both age and gender: in remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. in comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. there was a clear gender divide: divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position. in fact, according to pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. new data reveals who's likely to get married more than once good news for romantics: the divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise. according to new findings from the pew research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. "there's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general," gretchen livingston, senior researcher at pew and author of the study, told the huffington post. it's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. a majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. while today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. (but it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.) there are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to livingston. "but i think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing." the more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. but don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux. overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again. only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle. among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry. previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. in 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said "i do." this age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the american family. "i was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage." age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though.
vinka barunga was one of six aboriginal medical students to graduate from the university of western australia this year — and now she hopes to return to her home in a remote part of the state to become the town's first indigenous doctor. "i hope that one day it gets to a point where it's not a significant thing that an aboriginal person is studying medicine," said ms barunga, who grew up on the outskirts of the kimberley town of derby. when michael partnered taylor at the 16th gold coast debutante ball for disability, they had already decided they would spend the rest of their lives together — and our video of their love story has had more than 13 million views on social media. the storm cell brought tragedy and tears to many who lost loved ones, livelihoods, and homes, but when the iconic little australian was rescued — and named after rescuer louise haynes — her fate was soon being followed by thousands of fans on social media. louise the infant koala — a squeaking, wet, grey bundle of fur found on the ground after the east coast storms — became a symbol of hope after wild weather hit australia's east coast in june. the shower van was trialled in brisbane earlier this year and, with the help of the victoria-based shine on foundation, has since permanently set up in melbourne. the 61-year-old, who was born into a conservative family in south africa, only found her individual style when she was in her 40s after working in finance for 14 years. amber galloway gallego is not your everyday american sign language (asl) interpreter — she specialises in the interpretation of music, in real time and in front of thousands of people. dave 'bushie' brum, who has lived on the streets for more than 20 years, said it was "bloody awesome ... to have a real shower". a bedroom that resembles a sewing room may not be a dream set-up for most pre-teen boys, but campbell remess is not like most 12-year-olds. the brisbane duo famous for launching the world's first free mobile laundry for the homeless launched their second charitable venture in june — a shower van. taylor anderton and michael cox, who were both born with down syndrome, have known each other for six years and been a serious couple since last year. and what began with one citrus-lined street is now an 11-street suburban enclave, paved with seasonal fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, that encourages growing, sourcing and eating fresh food in the public realm. disgruntled over the price of a lime, two queensland locals started australia's first integrated, edible streetscape in a bid to live a simple organic lifestyle of community and fresh food. yes, 2016 was a pretty bad year all around, but you might just need a dose of good news in time for the festive season. the boy from hobart makes teddy bears for sick children, and he captured the hearts of millions around the world after a video about his good deeds went viral. ms galloway gallego has performed at more than 400 concerts, interpreting a stunning array of artists over the years including kendrick lamar, madonna, cyndi lauper and the black keys. get a dose of 2016's best feel-good stories here...

we already know parrots are really good at mimicking human speech and other sounds around the home, but the parrot in the video below has a talent that you would definitely not expect. in all fairness, kili has been practicing this move for about half a year know, and his owner says she’s only gotten better over time. we’ve all seen dogs do this trick really well, but this is the first time i’ve ever seen a parrot do it. no matter what is going on around her, the parrot won’t move until she gets the cue. if you wouldn’t know what was going on, you would totally think this parrot was dead. in case you were wondering, kili is of the species poicephalus senegalus which is a green and black parrot native to west africa. in fact, kili’s owner managed to teach her over thirteen tricks. and this is not the only trick she knows. kili the senegal parrot has somehow managed to become a master at "playing dead." kili can now lye motionless on her back for 10 seconds or more and keep her head down to the floor. when her dad says "bang" i never thought she'd react like this — hilarious!

"royals" and "wrecking ball" were each singer's first no. despite lorde's recent billboard takeover, the two singers have appeared to remain friendly. but whatever her intentions are, lorde is doing just that. the host suggests possibly selena gomez or demi lovato, which prompts lorde to declare she "really enjoyed 'camp rock.'" 1 hit, so there's no need to get all bitter about anything. @lordemusic why r people so mean???

"men don't have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing," he writes to huffpost in an email. when researchers hid in a public restroom in a michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. seventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a "non-washing event" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by bradley corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products. for those who need a refresher, here's how to wash your hands correctly: for those who need a refresher, here's how to wash your hands correctly: for those who need a refresher, here's how to wash your hands correctly: michael sykes, founder of the humor site the international center for bathroom etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs. some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands. again, men were the grossest offenders: only 60 percent said they always washed their hands after using a public bathroom, compared to 74 percent of women. we should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it's our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting. flu season is here, and enterovirus d68 has spread to all but three states in the continental u.s. handwashing can protect against both, says the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the biggest mistake you're making in the bathroom it's a good time of year to reflect on our handwashing habits. "many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands," borchgrevink says. men were 2.5 times as likely to say they "didn't feel the need." "they're not as thoughtful and they don't like to be told what to do." men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up. men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. the simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. "men are less concerned about things," study author carl p. borchgrevink, an associate professor at michigan state university, tells the huffington post. six seconds, far short of the cdc's recommendation for a 20-second scrub. the average handwashing time?

* clinton prepares for slime-fest debate: politico’s annie karni reports that the clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with trump: the person picked to be hillary clinton’s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of vincent foster, label her as a rapist’s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of monica lewinsky and gennifer flowers....one of the key components of that prep...is finding a person who can stand in as donald trump during mock debates and launch personal attacks...that will make the real trump look tame by comparison. while this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. but the conventions are over, and the clinton team — operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own — appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about trump’s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job. * trump would probably send troops to mideast: the new york times makes a good point about trump’s big foreign policy speech yesterday: though mr. trump made no reference to whether he would send more american troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication. meanwhile, the post/abc poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of republicans say trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall americans said the same. but france has a serious domestic terrorism problem — would french citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...in short, trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the state department about how to approach this issue. but in that same time frame, donald trump’s campaign still hasn’t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $12.4 million over the airwaves. here’s one reason it could happen the morning plum: the other day, new york times polling analyst nate cohn laid down a useful marker for gauging whether the conditions are taking shape for hillary clinton to crush donald trump in a landslide. the kind of relentless attacks on the islamic state he advocates — along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law — would require a considerable presence by american troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones. * clinton owns the airwaves: chuck todd, mark murray and the first read crew serve up these striking numbers: hillary clinton’s campaign...has spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million. now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply. for clinton, the percentages of democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them. even more crucially, clinton is demolishing trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say trump does. * quote of the day, everyone-hates-trump edition: the post write-up of the new virginia poll includes this gem from a republican-leaning voter in the state: walt purnell, 71, a retired business executive from ashburn, had hoped to vote for jeb bush — or john kasich. a recent washington post/abc news survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of republicans agreed that trump is "not qualified to serve as president," while 74 percent said he is qualified. ***************************************************************************** * clinton holds wide lead in virginia: a new washington post poll finds that clinton leads trump in virginia by 52-38 among registered voters and by 51-43 among likely voters. cohn noted that the gop nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them. the terror group is the direct result of the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003....at best, one could argue that actions that obama failed to take (over clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of isis. but note trump’s numbers among republicans on the temperament question: fewer than one in five republicans believe trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. this once again suggests that trump’s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in states that are supposed to be very close (as virginia was in 2012). 1 of 57 full screen autoplay close skip ad × hillary clinton’s campaign comes to an end view photos hillary clinton loses to donald trump in the 2016 presidential election. to be clear, trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting republican voters in the home stretch. and this core imbalance goes deeper: only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party. * trump’s big lie about isis: trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that obama policies were the chief cause of isis. "many republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president," cohn wrote. never trump conservatives and democrats both agree that the gop’s nomination of trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the gop among a whole new generation. michael gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences: younger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as "politically correct." * trump’s policy gibberish: trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. cue up a fresh round of commentary claiming that trump’s "street fighting" debate style should make democrats very, very afraid — even though thus far it has been a buffoonish failure. they are less likely to believe in "reverse discrimination" and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudes....young people understand the logo of the republican nominee...as conveying a message of exclusion. note: the poll also finds that trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of women and 70 percent of white college graduates. "i think he’s a failure, i think he’s a fraud, i think he’s a con artist, i think he’s insane," purnell said. these are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year. "if mr. trump can’t reunify republican-leaning voters, mrs. clinton really could win in a landslide." the new nbc news/survey monkey tracking poll finds clinton leading trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. have we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on trump’s fundamental unfitness for the job? what’s always missing from trump’s account is that clinton was more hawkish than obama was. (the washington post) today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape. speaking in warren, mich., on aug. 11, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton outlined her vision for the u.s. economy. * trump may cost gop a generation of voters: trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters. the idea is really an effort to repackage trump’s muslim ban as somehow being in sync with american values. nov. 9, 2016 hillary clinton speaks in new york while her husband, former president bill clinton, applauds. also, trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. caption hillary clinton loses to donald trump in the 2016 presidential election. it’s another fundamental trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch. this basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. that’s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for team clinton. among all adults, 61 percent said trump is not qualified. for example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? trump’s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. that’s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending. meanwhile, kessler’s interview with author joby warrick explores all this in more detail. cnn analyst peter bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best: this seems unworkable. (by contrast, 39 percent of democrats say that about clinton.) it is the way to lose a generation. but this general finding shows up in other polls, too. melina mara/the washington post buy photo wait 1 second to continue. it regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. external events or new clinton revelations could still shake things up. glenn kessler corrects the record: this is false and facile. is clinton headed for a landslide win? it seems very likely to tighten. with a healthy assist from trump himself, of course. it’s a scam. no way. but trump? or marco rubio. or chris christie.
as explained via a recent blog post by krebsonsecurity, there are websites that can read the barcodes on your boarding pass and provide someone else access to your travel information--your phone number, frequent flyer number, and information not only about the flight in question but also all future flights booked through the same number. you're heading somewhere exciting and you just can't wait until you get there to share the news with your friends on social media. with access to your boarding pass, someone could even change your seat on the plane, cancel any future flights, and reset your account pin number. you may love your friends, but would you trust everyone you know on facebook or twitter with your private travel information? so you snap a picture of your boarding pass and post it to facebook. the takeaway here: don't post pictures of your boarding pass on social media. because the information printed on your boarding pass actually reveals a lot more than you think. the one thing you should never do with your boarding pass you're at the gate. you've got your boarding pass. didn't think so. maybe not. harmless, right?
what’s come to be known as the "delaware loophole" — the unassuming building at 1209 north orange street — has become, as the guardian described reportedly dozens of fortune 500 companies — coca-cola, walmart, american airlines, and apple, to name a few — use delaware’s strict corporate secrecy laws and legal tax loopholes by registering the north orange street address for official business. "a magnet ... which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes," as a delaware’s incredibly business-friendly structure that allows for such a crowded address is completely legal, though the ability to create shell corporations lends to shady dealings and isas a report by the institute on taxation and foreign policy has described. trump and hillary refuse to explain why they both share the same address (antimedia) wilmington, de — as it turns out, hillary clinton and donald trump share something pertinent in common, after all — a tax haven cozily nested inside the united states. while the legitimacy of taxes as a concept may be up to personal interpretation, what matters in clinton’s use of the so-called delaware loophole, in particular, is her constant harping on the need for corporations and elite individuals to pay their fair share. "big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse — all have turned up at the delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks," the new york times’ leslie wayne "it’s easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked." in fact, some have claimed — all revelations of panamanian documents aside — the use of tax-friendly locations inside the u.s. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. as rupert neate explained for the guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows "companies to legally shift earnings from other states to delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state." of the 515 companies trump officially registered with the federal election commission, "we have 378 entities registered in the state of delaware," the billionaire told the guardian, "meaning i pay you a lot of money, folks. "some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in panama and elsewhere," clinton "we are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in america." and, as the guardian notes, both of "the leading candidates for president – hillary clinton and donald trump – have companies registered at 1209 north orange, and have refused to explain why." as it turns out, hillary clinton and donald trump share something pertinent in common, after all — a tax haven cozily nested inside the united states. still, clinton’s constant moralizing on tax transparency — and her spokesperson’s claims she hasn’t benefited from the north orange street address — proves, yet again, her stances offer little in the way of a solid foundation. according to neate, a clinton spokesman explained, "zfs [holdings, llc] was set up when secretary clinton left the state department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. why, if what the spokesman claims to be true, would clinton bother using an address in delaware? clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes. no federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the clintons as a result of this structure." this brick-and-mortar, nondescript two-story building in wilmington, delaware would be awfully crowded if its registered occupants — 285,000 companies — actually resided there. in other words, clinton’s employment of north orange street amounts to a telling,. "famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax." the’ leslie wayne described in 2012. do as i say, not as i do. clinton told the pennsylvania afl-cio annual constitutional convention earlier this month. i don’t feel guilty at all, ok?" oh, the irony.
you won't believe who usain bolt says is his biggest inspiration the world's fastest man, nine-time olympic gold medalist usain bolt, gave a very surprising shoutout to one of the world's most popular comedians in a live q&a on facebook. true "now, surprisingly, kevin hart is one of my biggest inspirations because he's always working out. and when i met her, all i said was, 'hi, nice to meet you.' bolt was asked who or what inspires him, and mentioned his father and track legend michael johnson before opening up about his appreciation for kevin hart. true bolt also said he was very nervous about meeting beyonce. so it's something that i definitely look forward to and try to work on." when i look at that, i'm like, i have to work out. i had a conversation all lined up that i was going to do. layne murdoch / getty images hart actually beat bolt in a [not very fair] footrace a few years ago. and that was it." i was really nervous.

the only way to stream seasons broadcast in the past three years is through hbo go, which is only available to hbo subscribers saddled with an expensive cable package. older shows like "the wire" and "big love" will be available in their entirety, while the newest seasons of "girls" and "veep" won't be available for three more years. the main catch is that only shows that have been out for three or more years will show up on amazon prime. "the sopranos," "six feet under," "deadwood" and many other hbo classics will be made available to subscribers of amazon prime on may 21, the two companies announced wednesday. this deal could be a blow to netflix, which has been in competition with amazon's streaming service since its inception. hbo go is also coming to amazon's new $99 streaming media player, amazon fire, by the end of the year. amazon prime just got way better if you have amazon prime, you officially no longer need your roommate's mom's neighbor's hbo go password to finish your "sopranos" binge-fest. a few, like "the sopranos," are available through netflix's dvd rental service and are generally available for purchase on dvd. last august, netflix snatched up an exclusive streaming deal with the weinstein co. for its movies, including "the artist" and "the king's speech." in addition to streaming video, it also includes free two-day shipping on many goods sold by the online retail giant and access to kindle's lending library. one twist: certain tentpole franchises in the hbo universe, including "game of thrones," "sex and the city," "entourage," and "curb your enthusiasm" are not part of the amazon deal, re/code reports. this is the first time hbo content has been available on an online-only streaming service. hbo signed a deal with amazon to make its archive of television programs available for streaming for prime customers. don't have prime or hbo go and still want to watch classic hbo shows? both amazon and netflix have also released their own original shows to entice new subscribers. these series are apparently just too popular for hbo to give up. right now, an amazon prime subscription costs $99 per year. that price went up from $79 last march.

yes there are good surprises in the new iphones as well (most notably in the iphone 7 plus) but if you didn’t buy an iphone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea... ___ more on forbes apple ios 10 has 25 great secret features apple ios 10.0.1: should you upgrade? the famously diligent test site ran the iphone 7 through the durability tests and claims apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens: the revelation comes after jerryrigeverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the mohs’ scale of mineral hardness. and here’s where it gets interesting, because apple still advertises that both the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. firstly you can invest in ‘touchscreen gloves’ which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that’s a bogus claim that these don’t work, but i’ve tried two pairs and they do). but two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iphone 7 to regret their purchase... ‘great features’ and ‘nasty surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines. previously his tests on the iphone 6s confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iphone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire. nasty surprise #2: new home button, new limitations the controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by myke hurley, eagle eyed founder of relayfm, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure. for example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iphone design for apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. if sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iphone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). as he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing. apple iphone 7 plus has a great secret feature iphone 7 vs iphone 7 plus: what's the difference? apple iphone 7 has two nasty surprises questions over supply remain and there is no doubt ’s new iphones are already proving immensely popular. this despite the fact iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus prices were increased compared to the iphone 6s and iphone 6s plus in every country. this means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. but the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from ifixit illustrates below). all of which leaves me in two minds about the iphone 7’s biggest external changes and who they really help the most. secondly you can setup assistivetouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. i’m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. i have put these claims to apple and will update when/if the company responds. instead earphones with the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus are just wrapped around a piece of card. given the new iphones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. note: as jerryrigeverything has not tested the iphone 7 plus we cannot make assumptions here. he concludes: "we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire." being the more expensive model, it’s possible sapphire is still used there. iphone 7 vs iphone 6s: what's the difference? meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. there are a couple of ways around this. hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves. personally a far bigger battery would’ve been top of my list. designed by apple - for apple? the first concern comes courtesy of popular youtube channel jerryrigeverything. feel free to insert your joke of choice here. that’s right, you get nothing. then there are little cost cutting omissions. nasty surprise #1: goodbye sapphire?
today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website okcupid and by facebook, which last year added a tab for "custom" alongside "male" and "female," with some 50 options, including "agender," "androgyne," "pangender" and "trans person," as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version. among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked "men" or "women" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student id in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn’t match someone’s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person’s biological sex, and sex referring to a person’s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one’s romantic interests). in hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like "ze" and "xe," and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary. it might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the university of vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch. while in her 20s and living in new jersey, ms. brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, "honey, are you gay?" ms. brauer reached out to the registrar, keith p. williams, who worked with the university’s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students’ office and filling out paperwork. the university allows students like gieselman to select their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips. today’s students, who grew up with gay-straight alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already l.g.b.t.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms. "it’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it," said gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events. she also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: "if you’re struggling with it, give me a call any time and i’ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have." she then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student’s self-respect — and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. so far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the consortium of higher education l.g.b.t resource professionals, and hundreds more have contacted vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice. "some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they’re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new," said ms. ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on l.g.b.t. activists on campuses as diverse as penn state, university at albany, university of chicago, university of wisconsin, milwaukee, and university of california, riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first l.g.b.t student centers were established. by 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and mr. williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. certainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the american indian’s two-spirits or india’s hijras. while colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender. use of "they/them" is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is burlington that a colleague at feldman’s bagels, where gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was o.k. "it felt not only like i was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what i was like for the rest of my life." "it’s grown out of the process of really seeing how rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how rocko is their own person, and not a child," ms. miller said. "they said, ‘you don’t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.’" a second option, also being used in various trans communities, was "ze" (pronounced zee), a riff on the german pronoun "sie," with "hir" replacing "his/her." so many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the american association of collegiate registrars and admissions officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records. gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use "they" instead of "he" or "she." for years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. a decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. "they" has become an increasingly popular substitute for "he" or "she" in the transgender community, and the university of vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it. on the coffee table, a collection of angel cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like "discernment" or "balance" or "integrity," meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration. the task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student’s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. bowing to the faculty, the task force selected "ze" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. a university recognizes a third gender: neutral being a boy didn’t feel right, either: "i had a couple months where i gave it a go. ms. brauer’s first act upon being installed as the center’s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community. ms. brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning & ally center. they could also leave the field blank, or opt for "name only," indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun. "even within the same day or the next day i can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress," said gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. but the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories. at the apartment that afternoon, gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands. "before, it had been really difficult to explain how i was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. ms. brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student’s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname. sara miller, gieselman’s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed. gieselman began spending time at outright vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted. but the binary is a belief system at least as old as adam and eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there. since 2009, 1,891 university of vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for "ze," 10 for "they" and another 228 for name only. although ms. miller tries her best to always use "they/them" pronouns, she often slips up, but gieselman isn’t bothered. at last summer’s orientation for new faculty members, ms. brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the l.g.b.t. "i don’t even know what it was i was trying to show," gieselman, an eighth-generation vermonter, recounted with a laugh. in september, the university’s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include "they," as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the english language is constantly evolving. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.) "students proposed ‘they/them’ pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect," mr. williams recalled. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and "p.g.p.," or preferred gender pronoun. "i know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn’t necessarily say something about it," said alexa ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker. "but there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles," she said. gieselman leaned forward off the futon, swished the cards around, plucked one from the center, smiled, then read it aloud: "freedom." "anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. "at the time, it irritated me to no end," said ms. miller, a social worker. identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. "that’s how clueless i was," she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the penny cluse café in downtown burlington. pronouns?’" but ms. miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. how does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew gieselman wouldn’t. "this is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. occasionally gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels o.k. i came out to my mother, only my mother, because i became physically ill with depression." suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey." faculty and staff group at harvard, believes that vermont’s changes are nothing less than lifesaving. then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer. that’s the one!’" said gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. "as soon as i learned about a genderqueer identity, i was like, ‘oh! (anita would turn out to be her life partner — 32 years and counting.) this is what our struggle is going to be about? she knows i try," said ms. miller, slipping up again. gieselman’s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. "i said, ‘well, yeah, but only with anita,’ " recalled ms. brauer. on campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, p.c. robyn ochs, an educator who helped found an early l.g.b.t. i wore some masculine clothes and told my friends to call me emmett." to validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life." the change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country.

after my sophomore year of college, i started an internship at a nonprofit technology association in downtown washington, d.c. until that point, i’d only worked in retail and had no idea what to expect. take advantage of company-sponsored training opportunities the concept that employees should "skill up" to remain competitive has been around for several decades, and in the last years of the 20th century, companies had dollars to spend on tuition reimbursement and courses like dale carnegie. as you build your network of contacts, remember to follow up meeting a contact once is a wasted opportunity unless you periodically remind him or her of who you are and take steps to grow the relationship over time. be humble and willing to learn from any task in the 90s, if your boss asked you to grab coffee or make copies, you did it with a smile. if you worked in a business office in any city in the world, you were expected to behave professionally, adhere to hierarchies, and generally do what you were told without making waves. if you make them wait, they might just lose it.s back in the day, we arrived exactly on time for interviews. never has this advice been more critical than today, when, thanks to the speed and ease of digital communication, your secret will be heard by the wrong person – guaranteed. individual company cultures may be more unique today (conservative versus liberal, strict versus playful) but the need to examine and then fit into a new culture – whatever it may be – remains. success is not about effort, it’s about visibility and value early in my career, i made the mistake of churning out work product that no one ever saw. when we thought people were busy then – filing paperwork, sending faxes, and leaving voicemails – we had no idea what we were in for. in the 90s, i was encouraged to send snail mail holiday cards to former bosses and colleagues, and even to pick up the phone occasionally. a bad attitude will break your reputation losing your cool at work has always been frowned upon, and despite claims of a kinder, gentler 21st century workplace, it still is. however, by the time you reached a senior level, you were advised to take it up a notch with tailored suits and pricey shoes and accessories. we asked politely for networking conversations and check-in meetings with our bosses that fit into a half hour slot in the day planner. and now, the stakes are higher because your epic in-office rant won’t just be a legend passed down from employee to employee. junior level professionals in the 90s could wear business casual, which consisted of khakis and polos for guys and slacks or skirts paired with nice blouses for women. doors open based on who you know in the late 90s, these were physical doors rather than virtual ones, but the concept is the same. you understood that you were paid for the privilege of watching and learning as the higher-ups did the real work. today’s emphasis on lean teams and productivity means that adding and communicating value is more important than ever. it’s only a matter of time before individuals will be responsible for 100 percent of their professional development. be respectful of others’ time back in the day, we arrived exactly on time for interviews. when applying for a job or looking to connect with someone, name-dropping would increase your odds of getting a positive response. today, those with little experience may feel empowered to say no to grunt work, but that doesn’t mean refusal is a smart idea. today, although we have exponentially larger networks thanks to social media, deep, in-person relationships still provide the greatest networking benefit. and it still does – even if the executives in your company now wear jeans and hollister tee-shirts. basing your appearance on that of the executives sent a very clear signal that you intended to climb the ladder quickly. i didn’t get ahead until i made sure my managers were aware of how my contributions were impacting the bottom line. instead, it could be taped on a phone and broadcast on social media for perpetuity. dress for the job you want like business culture, business dress was once straightforward. if you make them wait, they might just lose it.s in 2016, people are so overscheduled and frazzled that they take their iphones to the bathroom. in a new situation, aim to assimilate corporate culture used to be "one-size-fits-all." in 2016, training opportunities are scarcer and more varied (online, in-person, etc. i asked my father and a professor for advice. twenty years later, it’s all about linkedin. human nature hasn’t changed and humility will get you everywhere. ), but they should still be coveted. remarkably, 20 years later much of that guidance still resonates.

a dietitian specializing in sports nutrition can provide advice about whether someone like your son can safely switch to a vegan, plant-based diet, and the best way to do that. vegan athletes do need to be diligent about consuming sufficient protein, said nancy clark, a sports nutrition expert in massachusetts and the author of "nancy clark’s sports nutrition guidebook." so you, your son and his coach might wish to consider whether he wants to be the most willowy player on the field and adjust his diet accordingly. my 15-year-old son has decided that he needs to switch to a vegan diet and practice calisthenics to get lean and fit. "i have clients who say, ‘oh, i put a few chickpeas in my salad.’ that’s not going to do it. you can take comfort, too, in the science about vegan athletes, which generally shows that, as one recent scientific review concludes, "a vegan athlete can compete effectively at a high level." vegan athletes, like the bodybuilder kenneth williams, below, also may require supplements of b12, a vitamin found only in meat, and possibly of calcium, she said, especially if they are young and growing. interestingly, football players sometimes shy away from vegan diets, because it is hard to consume enough plant-based calories to add bulk. you can find the names of registered sports dietitians at the academy of nutrition and dietetics’ eatright.org website. plants, seeds and soy provide protein but in a form that is less absorbable than protein from meat. so "you need to eat a lot of it," ms. clark said. i think that he is already lean and fit at 140 pounds, 5-foot-10-inches, size 11 feet, and buff. i am not sure that going vegan is a good route. you need to eat cupfuls of chickpeas." can athletes be vegans? who can educate us about his plan?
the story was immortalised in a best-selling book, marching powder, and now the book's protagonist - a former inmate - and author have reunited to return to the prison for a new documentary film. rusty young wrote marching powder in his twenties, when as a young backpacker from sydney, australia, he stayed in the prison, and later helped secure mr mcfadden's release by posing as an international human rights lawyer. the documentary wildlands uses their story in san pedro prison as a launch pad for exploring all sides of the drugs trade, and includes interviews with former undercover us police agents and an assassin who was a right-hand man to colombian drug lord pablo escobar. back to jail it is 20 years since bolivia's chaotic san pedro prison became a tourist attraction, a place where backpackers stayed for weeks and partied with inmates. it all began when mr mcfadden, a british-tanzanian, was caught smuggling cocaine in la paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison. there was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory. in 2013, the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12-year-old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail, after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men. their san pedro tour guide came to their wedding after his release, and although the couple has since separated, she still has their dog, named pedro after the prison. the main concern locally was not the tourists but the alleged corruption of the authorities, who were thought to be taking a cut of the tours' profits. when rusty young and thomas mcfadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary wildlands, they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them, incognito. for years, its tours were an open secret, but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside. "as a conversation starter, we used to say we met in a bolivian jail," she says from her new home in sydney. thomas then moved to tanzania, and rusty went back to australia, where after the huge success of marching powder he had difficult-second-book syndrome. their unusual relationship began when mr young joined one of the illegal prison tours that the inmate ran for foreign backpackers from early 1997 until his release. however, his life-changing friendship with his "brother rusty" has gone the distance, and he has even named one of his children after him. lydia docking, a british traveller, went on not just one but repeated trips to the prison in 2008, led by a prisoner from portugal. today backpackers typically opt for la paz walking tours, which stop outside the prison walls and tell marching powder's story. they found work as english teachers and worked on the book, which became a new york times best-seller. "but i always wanted to go back to bolivia, and there was always a strong connection between me and rusty." one of the other backpackers she met on her first day there later became her husband. narcos director jose padilha has been linked to the screenplay, and don cheadle and then chiwetel ejiofor expressed interest in playing thomas mcfadden, but filming never got off the ground. after his release in 2000, he left those days far behind and is now a chicken farmer in tanzania. travellers paid an entrance fee and, in some cases, opted to stay for weeks, partying with the inmates. word had spread around local hostels that there was an english-speaking inmate who would show visitors around this strange microcosm. centrally located in downtown la paz, the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in lonely planet guidebooks. prisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate. back in 2000, the two men travelled to colombia, after mr mcfadden's release. i even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there," thomas mcfadden remembers today. his novel colombiano, about a teenager who gets drawn into a colombian terrorist organisation, is due out later this year. despite her jokes, she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story. the inmate, thomas mcfadden, says returning to his old cell scared him. it was mostly just to share experiences and to understand how lives start the same but can take such different paths." while waiting in the plaza outside, the cameramen caught a steady stream of tourists going in. but the long-awaited marching powder feature film may still be years away. "my publishers been harassing me about that for years," says rusty. armed with the footage, the bolivian press ran with the story. during the ensuing "clean-up", prisoners had their visitors' rights revoked for a day. "they kept making factual errors, so i couldn't help asking smart-arsed questions," says mr young. the rights were acquired by brad pitt's production company but have since expired. "i'm still confused by it, still processing it," she says. eventually an irish traveller, who had just read the book, recognised the pair. as for the sequel to the book, perhaps that will come sooner. san pedro prison remains operational today, despite many plans to close it. "over the course of three weeks, we went most days. she was 24 at the time and is 33 now. child welfare charities called for a ban on children living inside. "we already have a title: marching on." "i thought what is this place? a riot followed and around 80 children were evacuated. and we sneaked off together for a beer." "who is watching the police?" asked an editorial in la razon newspaper. large-scale tours of the prison are no longer possible. "he whispered, 'you're rusty, you're thomas!' i sometimes question why.
finding a dark moon until this new discovery, scientists believed makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the kuiper belt (pluto, haumea, makemake and eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, ceres, is closer to earth and also moonless. if mk2 was created by an enormous crash between two kuiper belt objects, according to the paper, "the apparent ubiquity of trans-neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds." while it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called mk2, was very good at remaining hidden. if you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in parker’s words, "not actually that faint"), but it was easy to miss before. since mk2 will allow scientists to tell makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets. mk2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to earth, so we don’t see it circling makemake, only oscillating back and forth. "that's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable," parker said: mk2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet makemake. as caltech’s mike brown, a member of the team that discovered makemake in 2005, said, "the wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. makemake is sometimes referred to as "pluto’s little sister" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees fahrenheit. "this new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system," buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us. according to parker, "the discovery of this moon has given us an opportunity to study makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion." even before then, though, information about makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. when pluto’s largest moon, charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. part of a team from the southwest research institute in boulder, colorado, parker was the first to notice makemake’s moon in data from the hubble space telescope. recent observation by the hubble space telescope, however, has revealed that makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon. if mk2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between makemake and another kuiper belt object. however, mk2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from makemake’s past atmosphere. "pluto’s little sister" makemake has something even pluto doesn't » second nexus the dwarf planet makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. it sits in the kuiper belt beyond neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than earth and completing an orbit once every 310 earth-years. the new, improved makemake system while mk2 does create questions about the makemake system and the kuiper belt, it will also provide answers. more observations of mk2 from hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. however, makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward earth, a fairly unlikely situation. this is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover makemake) in place. if all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that kuiper belt objects are often subjected to huge impacts. small worlds like makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more "exotic" ices and compounds. makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after pluto). looking at how mk2 orbits makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. the moon in the data it is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader marc buie, "has anyone seen the moon in the makemake data?" observations from the spitzer and herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. if mk2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in makemake’s gravity as it floated by. the james webb space telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. "imagine that the dark material isn’t on makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!" the discovery that makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to pluto. looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. but we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story." many smaller kuiper belt objects have dark surfaces like mk2. "if the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!" the "dark moon hypothesis" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting makemake. when buie replied, "there’s a moon in the makemake data?" however, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of makemake’s light and heat. at first, he thought someone else must have already seen it. they knew they’d made a major discovery. image analysis lead and paper coauthor alex parker tweeted.
3 cities that are reportedly being considered for gta 6 3 cities that are reportedly being considered for gta 6 with the existence of gta 6 promoting more mystery and rumours than any other game out there at the moment, there is one thing that remains at the core of gamers and fans minds when thinking about a new installment. there’s also been a lot of rumours that rockstar has abandoned development work on gta 6 to focus more on grand theft auto online but it’s a given that the game will eventually come out. it would also make sense being set in the u.s itself as gta has also been a great parody of america as a country. here’s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that gta 6 will surely be. london: it wouldn’t be new to the gta series, but it would make more a welcome return. london would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the u.k and eu. a good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older gta 5. chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a gta game. it would also make sense in a story-sense as tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the yakuza. with it’s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. tokyo: as mentioned above, tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime gta location. if gta returns to london, it would most likely be that of a different era. we look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment. however, that doesn’t mean there isn’t any talk about where the next gta game might take place. to name one, could tokyo by the next blueprint for rockstar’s series? it would also make sense to go back in time like vice city did. where do you think the next gta should be set? the windy city is known for its mirrored giant bean sculpture as much as its violent past. even though gta 5 is still doing well online. it would still be an interesting shift from west to east, however. it’s forward that rockstar will be looking. there’s been a few inklings so far. but is this too similar to the hong kong of sleeping dogs? even though that was set in china, it does seem aesthetically alike. where will it be set? especially in an updated fashion. chicago: john dillinger. maybe. al capone. frankie yale. let us know.
the cosmetics company has revealed that they'll be teasing their collaboration on snapchat, the photo- and video-sharing app that deletes photos mere seconds after a recipient views them. we can think of plenty of alternative fashion industry uses for snapchat, though; john galliano and kenneth cole might have liked to share their controversial outbursts across the ephemeral platform, or ill-conceived magazine shoots might live and die in a ten-second snap. we've been waiting since february for a glimpse of nars' forthcoming guy bourdin-inspired line -- and that's all we'll be getting for the moment. the line, which women's wear daily promises to "evoke the parisian fashion photographer's ambitious, provocative work," will be available permanently on october 15. snapchat can indeed be ambitious and provocative, but we're not certain how well the photo-sharing app can convey enough information to convince us to buy cosmetics. @narsissist's guy bourdin collection to debut on...@snapchat?
donald trump need only look in the mirror to see what’s sad and wrong, because what’s going on is trump losing one of his golf crown jewels to mexico due to his of stereotyping, hatred and bigotry. as the miami herald reports, it’s highly unusual to be unable to replace a sponsor in america’s televised professional sports leagues: losing a title sponsor, whether of a sporting venue or event these days, defines common. so it only makes sense that they’re following nbc’s lead in firing the shameless race-baiter from hosting one of golf’s top events now that he’s hurting the sport’s cash flow with his radioactive remarks. golf’s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into america’s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member’s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, african-americans, latinos and jews from many private courses. trump’s open bigotry caused cadillac to pull out as the title sponsor, and nobody else in corporate america wanted to touch trump’s signature golf course with a ten foot pole. the orange-faced one is surely red in the face with embarrassment and rage as mexicans publicly make a loser out of the profane bigot who dreams of building border walls at mexico’s expense. there is little doubt that the racist republican’s presidential campaign has cost the vulgarian’s company the prestigious pga cadillac championship tournament at trump doral resort, home to the famed blue monster. trump handled the news poorly, blurting this out on a fox news appearance: "they’re moving it to mexico city which, by the way, i hope they have kidnapping insurance. now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which trump declares he wants to build a wall. the pga needs a clean break from the sport’s less than glorious past track record for racial relations after an era when afro-american-asian legend tiger woods was by far the top draw for the sport. mexican conglomerate grupo salinas has picked up sponsorship when no american corporation would, and the television production and financial service behemoth got the golf tournament location they wanted in return: mexico city. the presumptive republican nominee’s golf resort business is going to be awfully lonely once six more months of his endlessly crass remarks of intolerance and hatred get plastered across the internet. the professional golf association (pga) has decided to not hold their pga tour event at miami’s trump doral resort. instead, they will be moving the prized golf tournament – which has been held in miami since 1962- away to mexico city. being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. it is so sad when you look at what’s going on with our country." where they moved it to will infuriate him donald trump continues to pay the price for his racist and divisive rabble-rousing. it only took the new york real estate mogul and scam university pitchman four short years to destroy the relationship and lose the deal. but they’re moving it to mexico city. pga just cancelled a huge tournament at trump’s resort. and i’m saying, you know, what’s going on here? even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the pga signed lucrative sponsor agreements.

when she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories. doctors couldn't find a reason, until she found it herself the one thing any teen doesn’t want to have happen to them is rapid, unexplained weight gain. and when she paid for an mri scan herself after doctors wouldn’t help her, she found that there was a 4 mm tumor in her brain. "i believed the doctors after i first saw them," said lizzie, "but over time i thought there was something else wrong because i’ve always been thin." she has medication to regulate her hormone levels, and she’s back to a healthy lifestyle that’s causing the weight to melt away. lizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn’t without psychological cost. now that she’s finally had it removed, she’s so glad to be rid of the problem. i was just glad i was right and i wasn’t just making it up." "no one could get to the bottom of it and find out what it was. but lizzie denison-ward, a now 20-year-old girl, had this happen to her for two years. "after i found out it was a tumor i was more relieved than anything. "the tumor took over my whole body and now i can finally go back to living like a normal student." she went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years. by the time she had the mri, she had gone up ten dress sizes. the tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. she couldn’t tell why, since she had always been slender. she put on 100 pounds in just two years. it was a real low time and i was feeling depressed." not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face. she kept seeing her doctor, but to no avail. she started gaining weight in november 2013. if left undetected, it could have killed her. she told the daily mail her story. she had cushing's disease. but even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. five weeks later, lizzie has already lost 21 pounds. she decided to do some private research. so she did. her mother worried about her too.
check out the short but informative men's hair tutorial of achieving the most popular hairstyle in america.h/t - gq pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. tv shows like mad men brought back the don draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.with a population of roughly 318 million people here in the u.s., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. gq shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:the popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.the word is out. check out the short but informative men's hair tutorial of achieving the most popular hairstyle in america.h/t - gq ask your barber to scissor-cut the top of your head to about an inch and a half, adding a bit of texture to the ends with a razor. the prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in hollywood: ryan reynolds.the style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. but when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from schenectady to cincinnati, portland to nashville, juneau to nyc, and every city in between. around the sides and back, have him use a clipper to taper the length down to about a quarter inch, or an eighth if you feel like going really short. there's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. the clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. you do your 'do the way you do!perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in iowa.sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. this gives the face a squared look, where the sides are blended straight up and the top is slicked back with no visible part. out of all men's haircuts, this is the most requested in america preferred haircuts for men are constantly evolving. will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of dep gel? you could achieve a formal look by slicking the full part of your hair with a hairdryer and a denman brush for volume. time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler! the heavy-on-top style is juxtaposed with a side of cool, with facial hair and cool specs. popularized by musicians like rod stewart and david bowie (rip), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. get some gel and gather your hair up to one side with your fingers. gq recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. but which is the cut that gets requested the most? this haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. maybe the southwest prefers the caesar's cut.none of these styles were in hot demand. their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. this is the nation's popular haircut for now. still, it is not a popular haircut. the clean and classy look works very well here too! some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. so which cut made the cut? but how long can it last? perhaps the mullet dominates in kentucky or oklahoma. asymmetrical faux hawks give the appearance of playfulness. spritz some hairspray to firm it up. except for one particular style. no judgment here. wavy hair? they even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. want the same haircut? no problem. beau-haute!
chen told her fellow co-hosts on "the talk" that when she was a young local news reporter, her news director told her she would never make it to the anchor desk because she was asian and because of her "asian eyes." after describing her struggle over the decision, chen showed before and after pictures of herself, saying that the procedure gave her "bigger" eyes and that she looked more "alert" than before. @juliechen reveals painful secret julie chen revealed on wednesday that she had plastic surgery years ago to make her eyes look "bigger" and advance her career. "my lifelong dream was one day to be a network news anchor and if i can't even anchor in dayton, ohio, how am i ever gonna get to new york city?" "now, it's like i sometimes wonder — but i will say after i had that done everything kind of, the ball did roll for me. the revelation came as part of "secrets week" on "the talk," when one co-host reveals a secret everyday. she said that it made her "insecure," and a "big time agent" later told her the same thing. no one's more proud of being chinese than i am." the agent would not represent her unless she got eye surgery. "i don't like to live with regrets," chen added. did i give in to the man in doing this?'" "it felt like a dagger in my heart," chen recalled. "i did it. i struggle with, 'wow. i moved on. she said.

"these workouts are intense because of the fast-paced, minimal rest nature of them, so err on the side of caution and use less weight than you’d normally would so you don’t gas out too fast," he says. going all-out in a metcon workout can help you improve your work capacity, making your body more efficient for all those other activities you love doing, says lawson. "in other words, you’ll have an increased ability to lift more weights , and go for longer periods of time and distances without getting tired," he says. according to lawson, there are tons of benefits to metcon workouts, including improved fat loss, increased calorie burn compared to steady-state workouts, muscular strength gains, and improved cardiovascular function. try this: 5 dumbbell goblet squats 10 jumping jacks 5 dumbbell push presses 5 medicine ball slams rest for zero to 30 seconds rest between exercises, and zero to 60 seconds of rest between rounds. lawson suggests choosing three or four exercises and cycling through them with little rest between rounds (or none at all!) when you first get going, lawson suggests starting with just three of the exercises above instead of all four. (the more fit you are, the less rest you’ll need.) and one 2012 study in the journal applied physiology, nutrition and metabolism found that hiit workouts boost metabolism better than cardio alone.

i said , world war i is trench warfare, it can’t be fun to play.’ but anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path soderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company’s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1. if you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they’re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of world war i, i absolutely rejected it." the good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and i think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of ea is that the world war i theme is resonating with players out there. ea "absolutely rejected" battlefield 1’s world war 1 setting before this made it change its minds ea "absolutely rejected" battlefield 1’s world war 1 setting before this made it change its minds image: battlefield.com ea’s upcoming game battlefield 1 has received a lot of attention since the reveal trailer was released earlier this month. battlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the call of duty franchise from the number 1 position. the thing that andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for world war i, it wasn’t the most obvious choice. unlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, battlefield 1 is set during world war i. although we are all excited about battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game’s setting didn’t get rejected. this convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time. i think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for ea." while speaking at the investors day event, ea studios executive vice president patrick soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by ea. however, things changed after dice showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. the main reason of excitement for this new aaa game is the setting. this will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective.

(i felt so strongly about this newfound love that i wrote why it's better than all other types of chocolate). so that i don't have to bite into them with a vat of liquid red staring back at me? while mayo still ranks as the most popular condiment in america, ketchup is a close second. do you know how many delicious french fries i've had to enjoy with my eyes closed? eggs are one that hurt my heart, and don't even get me started on omelets. now watch how to make homemade ketchup: now watch how to make homemade ketchup: now watch how to make homemade ketchup: nope, i'm not a chicago native, but i do still think this is a sin. and that's because there isn't anything we're not dousing it on. i wish america's sweetheart could be something more interesting than ketchup, but alas, the numbers speak. © provided by delish one of the most prominent ingredients in ketchup? a single tablespoon has more sugar than a chocolate chip cookie. at least other condiments have signature textures: mayo is nice and creamy. mustard (maybe sauerkraut, too) on dogs only, never ketchup. he turned me on to white chocolate . but beyond that, hash browns, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets all disappoint me in their own way. he turned me off ketchup. it has that stinky tomato smell ... rancid even. y'all are too obsessed with it. it doesn't belong on a damn hot dog. © provided by delish sounds so hard to believe, right? i can never escape it. that gloppy texture is foul. it overpowers everything it touches. the smell. and it lingers ... but ketchup? 7. mustard is silky (kinda). 3. here we go: 1. sugar. 5. big time. 6. 2. forever. 4. hours.

obama, who was best man at the president’s wedding, said he spoke to his brother a year ago and was miffed that he did nothing to help his own foray into politics when he ran for governor of the southwestern kenyan county of siaya in 2013. why obama’s half-brother says he’ll be voting for donald trump july 24, 2016 | 5:26am president obama's brother, malik obama, says he plans to vote for donald trump in november. but the charity came under fire when the post revealed in 2011 that it was an off-the-books operation that hadn’t registered with the state of virginia or, as it claimed, had tax-exempt status from the irs. i would like to meet him.’ - malik obama "i feel like a republican now because they don’t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me," he said. the president’s and malik’s father, barack obama sr., left kenya in 1959 when malik was a year old and his mother was pregnant with his sister auma. photo: peter duke (left); getty images (right) president obama’s kenyan half-brother wants to make america great again — so he’s voting for donald trump. "i like donald trump because he speaks from the heart," malik obama told the post from his home in the rural village of kogelo. photo: getty images but malik obama bristles at the suggestion, saying he dug deep to pay for the electrical transformers and college scholarships that the foundation provided in kogelo. he says he started the charity in 2008 because he wanted to make a difference in the family’s hardscrabble village in kenya. obama, 58, a longtime democrat, said his "deep disappointment" in his brother barack’s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to "the party of lincoln." "honestly, i’ll be happy when my brother is out of office, and i will finally be out of the limelight and be able to live like a human being." obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage — so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. malik obama, the eldest, is the director of the barack h. obama foundation, a controversial virginia charity named for his father. obama used to live in maryland, where he worked for many years as an accountant and is registered to vote there, public records show. malik obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to khadafy and others who were "making this world a better place." "i still feel that getting rid of khadafy didn’t make things any better in libya," he said. obama sr. enrolled at the university of hawaii, where he met and married the president’s mother, stanley ann dunham. but what bothers him even more is the democratic party’s support of same-sex marriage. until then, obama wears his new gop colors proudly; he even has a "make america great again" hat. shortly after the post report, the irs gave its stamp of approval, leading to speculation that the president had intervened. he’s also annoyed that clinton and president obama killed libyan leader moammar khadafy , whom he called one of his best friends. obama plans to trek back to the us to vote for trump in november. obama made headlines in 2011 when he married his third wife, who was still in her teens. "i don’t think politics is my thing," he told the post. ‘i like donald trump because he speaks from the heart. "my brother didn’t help me at all," said obama. "my brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard." when asked by the post how many wives and children he has, obama demurred. malik obama lost the race, and spent $20,000 of his own money on the unsuccessful campaign. malik obama didn’t meet his younger half-brother until 1985. barack obama is seen with his half-brother, malik. malik obama seen announcing his intention to run for a kenyan gubernatorial seat. president obama, 54, has seven half-siblings from both sides of his family. according to its latest tax filing, the nonprofit has just $24,000 in its coffers. photo: ap "she should have known better as the custodian of classified information," said obama.

a renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, dr. sonia malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in new delhi, stated that 46% of indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. it’s okay to believe in the concept of yolo, but what’s the point if it’s not going to give you all the happiness you need to live happily? and while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it’s not the only one. some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the it, media industry and bpos. nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting ivf centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child. the food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per society for the study of male reproduction. another city gynaecologist named, dr. yashica gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men. studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. with the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days. this is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, dr. ved prakash. apparently, constant use of android or iphone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. 1 lakh, which could be a matter of concern to a lot of individuals. ivf or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. the minimum a couple spends on this is rs. infertility is no longer seen only in women. research reveals indian men are becoming infertile. there is a solution to every problem. but dear men, worry not! however, the treatments aren’t very budget-friendly. here's why!
jennifer lawrence knows exactly what she would say if she ever met donald trump jennifer lawrence is not known for keeping quiet on issues that she's passionate about, so it only stands to reason that she would have an especially vocal opinion on the presumptive republican presidential nominee, donald trump. though lawrence (presumably) did not get her moment of vengeance, we sincerely hope that this encounter can be fully realized someday — because it would probably be a moment of catharsis for all of us. during an appearance on the bbc's graham norton show on friday, lawrence told norton exactly how she felt about the donald. "cause i was just, i was adamant on finding him and then making a video of me going, 'hey trump, f*** you!'" he currently seems a bit preoccupied with taking down a recent new york times article about his relationships with women, but ten bucks says that later today he will tweet something along the lines of "jennifer lawrence: not very talented!" "i had my full security, like, i was like, 'find donald trump,'" she told norton. after learning this fact, lawrence was determined to have her own little "meet and greet" with trump. gee whiz, jlaw really is just like the rest of us! she loves eating, and she hates trump! just you wait and see. as for trump? apparently, the two powerhouse public figures were both attending the same concert one evening.
but there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. but in nebraska and maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver. the electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably democratic states like massachusetts and oregon—or reliably republican states like texas and alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. in those states, as well as in her nebraska ad buy, clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the children’s health insurance program in the 1990s. and as a clinton aide pointed out, the african-american share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters. so a republican candidate can win in the state, but a democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district. the second congressional district, which is centered in omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red nebraska. the advertising buy is focused on nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about clinton’s advocacy for children. this week he campaigned in maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a democrat. here’s why a democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in nebraska for more than 50 years. in 2014, when democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, democrat brad ashford won the district’s seat in u.s. congress. he held a rally in bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural. but on thursday, hillary clinton’s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. they can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright. clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: florida, ohio, colorado, iowa, nevda, new hampshire, virginia, north carolina. it is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. it’s an electoral strategy that donald trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. the district went for mitt romney in 2012 but for then-sen. barack obama in 2008. hillary clinton is advertising in deep-red nebraska. these are the two ads that will be playing in nebraska. they predictably vote democratic or republican.
the near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that bernie sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a trump victory more likely. while clinton would not be as ambitious as sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that clinton would preserve and implement the clean power plan and the global climate accord, and trump would seek to reverse them both. as i’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as trump — to roll back the clean power plan and/or withdraw from the paris climate deal. more important, with some reporters wondering what trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: he is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it. he added that he would "rescind" the epa’s clean power plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the u.s.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. i don’t believe sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the democratic primaries. my bet is sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative. — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) april 7, 2016 and: as a father of four and a grandfather of seven, i care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. but sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the clean power plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. it is often said that sanders may not help to unify the party because he has "nothing to lose" from a democratic loss. sanders knows that the paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. and at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a trump presidency. sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face: climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) april 7, 2016 it’s true that sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. the accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. but it’s possible that trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback. what’s more, even if the paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. unlike so much of what comes from trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications. introducing what he billed as an "energy plan," trump promised to "cancel the paris climate plan." trump said that the current environmental challenges that the obama administration is trying to tackle are "phony." the morning plum: believe it or not, donald trump has now made a very important policy statement. obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible. he would withdraw the u.s. from participation in that global accord. to get all the details on trump’s full energy plan, read brad plumer’s piece. i think that is wrong — i believe sanders when he says a trump presidency is unthinkable. indeed, i believe it’s likely sanders will see it this way, too. donald trump just made an extremely important promise. trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue gop agenda of "fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production." it’s one of his worst yet. this deepens the contrast between trump and hillary clinton.
owned by lvmh, it's one of the most stylish resorts in the maldives with its contemporary minimalist design (by architect jean michel-gathy), spaciousness (not just the size of the room; the resort's spa occupies another whole adjacent island), and extensive facilities to suit any tastes or needs (you have your own majordome for the entire stay who caters to your likes/dislikes and ensures your day runs just as you wish). use the capital santiago as a hub and fly to hot spots like the atacama desert in the north, patagonia in the south, or the mysterious easter island, famous for its nearly 900 monumental human figures with oversized heads carved right out of a volcanic mountain, then transported to different parts of the island  a gargantuan feat for mere humans. these extraordinary holiday trips will be the highlight of your year: one clear travel trend this year is that more asians are becoming free independent travelers (fit), eschewing the ordinariness of coach travel for the novelty  and bragging rights  of new places and experiences. for cities, zurich has the largest indoor christmas market in europe (until christmas eve) in the main hall of the central station where you can gorge on local treats from 160 stalls while your eyes feast on a christmas tree decorated with 10,000 swarovski crystals. another highlight of a chile trip, especially for avid hikers, is a 19km hike to the base of torres del paine (towers of paine) to view the three 2,000-meter granite towers in all their splendor, a sight guaranteed to floor anyone. as with all firsts, it's out to impress so you can expect keen service and a sparkling new vessel with such a wide range of facilities and entertainment it could be considered a destination on its own. best to check out hotels and resorts that offer a more authentic experience where the highlights can include visits to husky and reindeer farms, hunts for the northern lights with a guide, snow mobile safaris and winter fishing. the best time to visit the maldives is from the second half of december to april, making it another destination pick that's perfect for the holiday season. experiences available to asian tourists include running tours of helsinki, a two-day package to see the northern lights and a one-day trip incorporating two capital cities, tallinn and helsinki. other highlights include a unique singing tree in town (come closer to the tree and you'll see it is actually filled with children singing christmas songs) and the release of 800 floating candles into the river limmat on december 22. this includes a waterslide park, zouk nightclub (famous for its singapore and kuala lumpur locations), more than 35 restaurant and bar concepts, the first penfolds flagship wine vault at sea and a dreamscapes enrichment program that will offer talks and presentations from esteemed speakers. finland will mark its 100th year of independence next year and to mark the occasion, visit finland has launched a stopover finland initiative comprising 50 easily reachable packages/services lasting five hours to five days. there also aren't any large crowds at this time, making this a sublime place to have a silent night, holy night moment filled with love and gratitude. if you've been rewarded with a bonus as fat as santa himself, treat yourself to a stay at cheval blanc randheli. it's also worth mentioning that finland is the shortest connection between europe and asia, giving you even more reason to make the comparatively short trip. at least that's according to visit finland, finland's official tourism promoter which, together with finnair, has been recently courting asian visitors  to visit the country. the best time to visit is november to early march, so it's perfect for the holiday season. it sails out from hong kong or guangzhou in the south of china, and takes you to scenic destinations in vietnam including ha long bay and danang. everyone knowns santa lives in finnish lapland and it's time you pay him a visit for all those times he came to your house. lapland, the largest and northernmost region of finland, has 190,000 reindeers, 749 mountains and one santa claus. if you're after something different, why not eschew your boarding pass for a spot on a cruise? think spellbinding street lights and snowy villages, where the only problem you face is too much choice of where to go. joining the cruise on december 10, for instance, is american astronaut dr. leroy chiao, who will deliver a three-part lecture. while there is a santa's village there, this amusement park may be too commercialized for some. hop onto genting dream, the first cruise ship of asia's first luxury cruise line, dream cruises. christmas-at-sea: genting dream party all night at zouk on board genting dream. here are five extraordinary trips for them to make this holiday season. adventurous christmas: chile torres del paine, one of chile's wondrous sights. it's car-free, leaving the snow-covered streets gorgeously illuminated for the holidays. break the bank christmas: the maldives a garden villa at cheval blanc, randheli. for a holiday as rich as christmas pudding, switzerland is hard to beat. where to stay: the dolder grand (zurich); le petit cervin or the bellerive (zermatt). christmas in santa's home: finland northern lights, finland. though it's small, switzerland is multifaceted with a variety of history and traditions. then head to zermatt for an alpine experience. the sights are stupendous and varied: sand dunes, salt lakes, towering peaks, glaciers, geysers, lakes. chile has it all in vivid colors. photo credit: cheval blanc, randheli. premium christmas: switzerland car-free zermatt (canton valais). photo credit: switzerland tourism//christof sonderegger. where to stay: awasi atacama. photo credit: visit finland. photo credit: dream cruises. chileans are friendly and hosts at heart. and the matterhorn never fails to mesmerize. 2. photo credit: shutterstock. 4. 1. 5. 3.

this survey by the state-owned thai health promotion foundation said that, while thais don’t spend much of their time drinking or smoking, they are almost always physically active. study shows that most thais spend majority of time doing nothing a new survey says that, not taking into account sleeping time, thai people spend the majority of their waking hours being completely sedentary. we all know about the thai disinclination for walking anywhere, but wachira noted that so many hours without physical activity were bad for thai people’s health. speaking yesterday, wachira was referencing the results of a survey by mahidol university's institute for population and social research, reported the nation. we’re talking 14 hours that are spent not using their bodies for much of anything. they usually lie down while watching tv or checking their smartphones," said dr. wachira pengjuntr, the health department's director general. "foreign research shows being physically inactive hurts the metabolism and control of the blood-sugar level. this means people are at a risk of heart, coronary and brain diseases," he warned. they spend their day sitting inside cars, at their desk or in meeting rooms. "despite being awake, they are not physically active. 555. that’s funny.

to be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread (i’ll get some lettuce as well! to be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread (i’ll get some lettuce as well!). the researchers said foods deodorise garlic breath through two mechanisms – first, enzymes in the raw foods help to destroy the odours, and then, phenolic compounds in both the raw and cooked foods destroy the volatiles. researchers from ohio state university found that the best foods to banish garlic breath are raw apple and raw lettuce, the huffington post reports. the simple way to banish stinky garlic breath all the best foods are doused in garlic, but what about the lonely times that come after the clove cramming? volunteers were asked to chew garlic cloves for 25 seconds before trying water; raw, juiced or heated apple; raw or heated lettuce; raw or juiced mint leaves; or green tea, immediately after. wikipedia they believe this is why raw foods were the most effective because they contain both the enzymes and the phenolic compounds. although it didn’t get rid of the volatiles, mint leaves were best at masking the smell. when accused of housing that garlicky stench, i tend to take offence and charge them with being ungrateful for me protecting them from vampires. but if that doesn’t work, maybe you should try one of these scientifically proven odour eaters. plus, an apple a day keeps the odours away. heated lettuce sounds fucking grim. ).
a simple way to prevent the severe and deadly reaction is with an epipen which injects a measured dose of epinephrine into your body to stop the reaction, but it must be taken in a very short time window after being stung. this type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like john was stung by, but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to its stealth. it is not uncommon to hear about somebody being stung by a bee or a wasp of some sort, as such type of insects and little bugs are very common in the outdoors. that is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly. while getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung. hi wife went and grabbed john an ice pack to help reduce the swelling, and john sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful stings that were attacking his body. you never know when you might get stung by a bee, even if it’s just doing the front garden like john was. many people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting, and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime. it was only an hour after getting stung when john was gasping for air and told his wife three last words, "i love you" before he took his last breath and died. one man from tampa, florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn. it is important to get tested for this type of reaction if you are going to be spending time outdoors or doing yard work. john clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him. yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do. this was the case of a severe allergic reaction that john had experienced called anaphylaxis. john got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment. doctors did everything they could to get his system back up and running, but to no avail. soon after getting stung though, john started acting strange. he started experiencing numbness, and had difficulty breathing. he went to rip weeds from his lawn. you could be next. hours later he’s dead. be warned... something was evidently not right.
what you’ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. the dish you should never order in rome when it comes to dining in rome, there's a pasta dish to avoid—unless you know the one place to try it. but it did take off stateside thanks to a pennsylvania noodle company: pennsylvania dutch marketed a creamy sauce called alfredo after influential new york restaurateur george renart raved about the dish in the saturday evening post when he returned from a trip to rome. and it's definitely not what you would find in rome now, even if those trattorias from testaccio to prati had alfredo on the menu (which they don't). alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes—not because it isn't roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. that would be trattoria della scrofa, between piazza navona and the trevi fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in pecorino romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to italians at the time as milk was to the japanese. the version we eat now—loaded with cream, often with chicken—is a bastardization of what alfredo cooked up a century ago. that's because, fellow americans, roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. ask any true roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled "who is-a alfredo?" its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the trevi fountain. despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that mary pickford and douglas fairbanks ate it on their roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. what you won’t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers. in the early 1900s, the eponymous alfredo di lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. so he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? there seems to be molto confusion around the origins of fettuccine alfredo. which, in rome, is rewarding in its own right. sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu. "i always encourage travelers to seek out alfredo in rome," she says. "you just need to know where to go." but it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. local food expert elizabeth minchilli says no way. (then again, olive garden has yet to hit mediterranean shores.)
this is what happens to you if you drink 4 energy drinks a day for 7 years simply giving an energy drink a sniff should be all you need to be convinced that the stuff is not good for you. in a post which has since been made private, dion shared an image of herself strapped up to her heart monitoring machine, which she has to wear for 24 hours a day. dion says her former addiction has led to a serious heart condition, and also attributes her two miscarriages to the drinks. dion parratt is one such former addict, who used to knock back five cans of the stuff per day at the hight of her obsession. but for some people, energy drinks are a habit that’s as hard to break as the strongest alcohol or drug addiction. the pungent smell of taurine, acid, and a million different chemicals is enough to have me running for the hills. head over to the next page to find out what she wrote.
how i lost it: the initial start was to remove sugar from my diet, stop late-night eating and start using the gym membership that i had been paying for for two years. how one woman lost nearly 200 pounds name: delores curtis age: 59 height: 5'5" before weight: 350 pounds how i gained it: eating what i wanted and as much as i wanted and having no desire to exercise. i looked at every diet plan i'd ever been on and came up with a lifestyle plan that would that fit my daily routine and give me long-term results. later that evening as i sat on the couch looking at the picture, i noticed that my husband could barely put his arm around me. breaking point: three things: in july 2013, my husband took me with him on a business trip to dallas and the seat belt barely fit around me. we decided to stay an extra day to tour the new dallas stadium, and i couldn't walk the tour with my husband. for the first 30 days, i didn't eat any potatoes, pasta, white rice, flour, soda or sugar, and i drank no less than a gallon of water a day. for someone who could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, i feel like i got my life back! even after losing 20 pounds, i could only walk on the treadmill at the lowest speed, but i kept going. within six months to a year of starting my diet, my weight would creep back up to my heaviest. i knew ​giving up too much and feeling deprived wasn't going to work this time. i would be on it for an hour, take a break and get right back on. as much as i try to stay away from processed foods, in some cases, it's hard to avoid, so moderation is the key. i was so sick and tired of all the blood pressure, diabetes and acid reflux medicine. because at the end of every diet, you've got to get back to real life. one year later, my husband said, "i bet you can run that dallas stadium now!" i lost 20 pounds in 30 days and started going to the gym. ​my overall health wasn't good either: i was diagnosed with acid reflux, diabetes and high blood pressure. now, i can walk on the treadmill on its highest level for 45 to 50 minutes. i was sore for ​three months straight, but i kept going every day. now, i love going to the gym, and my energy level is off the charts. i looked at that woman in the picture and asked, "who are you?" i didn't know the woman looking back at me. i didn't have a lap; i couldn't hold my beautiful grandkids. i knew i needed to make a change but did i? i experimented with programs such as weight watchers and medifast, the cabbage soup diet and atkins. i ate myself up to a size 5xl and 30-32 blouses, 28-32 pants and 50 bra. i knew i had to do something different this time. i had to find a way to make it work longterm. i stuck with the treadmill for the first nine months. i went to dinner to celebrate july birthdays in my family. after weight: 169 pounds after weight: 169 pounds after weight: 169 pounds i was missing out on​ family vacations and life's precious events. i want to do everything: spinning, dancing, running, horseback riding, traveling the world. i'm no longer on any of the medications. i was so embarrassed and wanted to cry. i make my own snacks, like roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, cashews and roasted chickpeas. everybody who knows me is cheering me on. we all gathered to take pictures. shopping for clothes was pure hell for me. my meals consisted of baked chicken, fish and vegetables. i had had enough. i've learned to read labels. no.
the emergency warning has been downgraded to watch and act fire authorities in western australia say no properties were lost during a bushfire around the town of gwindinup south-east of bunbury, which has now been contained. "firefighters are mopping up, making the area safe and strengthening containment lines overnight and as the sun comes up and the day unearths tomorrow we'll check for trees and power lines and other safety hazards that may stop them returning to their homes," mr norman said. authorities are yet to begin an investigation in the cause of the fire, which has now been downgraded from an emergency warning to a watch and act. fiona butterly from down south boarding kennels in nearby argyle said on thursday she had a plan to leave, had she been advised to do so. water bombers assisted fire crews on the ground in the effort to protect homes from the blaze that burnt through more than 200 hectares of bushland. about 30 firefighters were sent to the area, and water bombers sent in to assist those on the ground. fire services superintendent peter norman said fire crews were still working to ensure it was safe for residents to return to their properties. ms butterly said they had contingency plans in place with other kennels and the local vet if they were asked to leave the area. "[we] can't smell smoke or anything at the moment, it's blowing in the other direction and there's no ash or anything like that." temperatures soared in western australia on thursday, with nearby donnybrook hitting 37 degrees celsius. a massive plume of smoke could be seen from bunbury, about 30 kilometres away. a temporary evacuation centre was established at donnybrook recreation centre on steer street in donnybrook. "[we can] definitely see smoke [but] no flames," she said. the temperature passed 41c in perth.
here’s what happens when you give $1,000 to someone in extreme poverty here’s what happens when you give $1,000 to someone in extreme poverty margaret osuma oshien from siaya, kenya — a person who received just under $1,000 cash unconditionally from givedirectly.org my wife, adrienne, and i are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving. i’ll hide this little gem in here: many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person’s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers. there was really no "savior barbie" complex in the givedirectly operation — no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what’s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission ‘save the world.’ 3.) after meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we’ve heard in the past: ) the vast majority of the team are local kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. we think that’s fantastic, since we’ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to gd goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in east africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. school fees — after primary school, kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2–4 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards. of course these people still have needs for more, but i can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and i don’t think other ngos can say the same. housing — everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and fyi we didn’t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (that size home would house 5–9 people)) this small mud shack is home to 5. from living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from givedirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her. we’ve told countless friends and family about givedirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as "eh, i only give people food," and others such as; "how do they make sure people aren’t defrauding them or stealing the cash?" i see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that’s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from givedirectly that sit in the recipients doorway / living room / foyer / children's’ bedroom / guest’s bedroom 4.) outside of givedirectly’s country headquarters in kisumu, kenya in august 2016, my wife and i visited givedirectly’s office in kisumu, kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the siaya (where president obama’s grandmother lives!) not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4) richard aura ongari from homa bay, kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from givedirectly. from handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural south africa — we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. ), is "negative and insignificant," meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...here is the 3rd party study conducted by princeton.edu this finding is consistent with a publication from world bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world. we even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at givedirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (i’m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they’re doing something, it’s because their data, and 3 other independent sources’ data has proven that’s the right decision. when we found givedirectly in november 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. cavin oginga (from kenya) — a field ops manager for givedirectly — who applied for a job there after running a research project on givedirectly’s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having. no home — living with 4–8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut c. upgrading home — living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls) d. dirt floor in home — constant insect infestation, including "jigas" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain. i think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses — only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. they have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process — from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there’s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited. before being able to afford the medication, richard could not walk, but now that he’s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren. now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. after dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers — and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. now, for the meat of it — we went into small kenyan villages and met these people who’ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). since we currently travel abroad full-time, and kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of gd’s operation. food — probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month’s worth of corn to feed their families. eunice’s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains. other — outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (cancer, hiv, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes. there’s a huge unemployment issue in kenya and other east african countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community. extreme poverty sits at the bottom of maslow’s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. the ‘mission’ per se of how gd gives isn’t about funding what they believe will have the most ‘profitable’ result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. "general angst about the "savior barbie" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a self-serving endeavor." unconditional — they can do anything they want with it — which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in ‘the west’ think it’s risky...or even foolish. she used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. 3 children of givedirectly recipient eunice awino omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in siaya kenya (where president obama’s grandmother lives!). beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. before receiving his $1,000 transfer from givedirectly, samwel odhimbo orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of lake victoria in homa bay, kenya. this house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family. they were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives. let’s face it — ‘data’ is boring and unsexy, yet it’s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. one of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from givedirectly in 2014. every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. we’re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. she applied to work for givedirectly (gd often has 200–600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. with gd’s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc. we’re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (rcts) — the holy grail of "i’m right and you’re wrong." the majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. this is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in givedirectly. a. thatched roof — which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1–3 years. i think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. "it probably doesn’t have long-term impact, such as building a school could." and we’re not talking about just any old data. here’s the breakdown of how their money was spent: 1.) givedirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?) shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. "i bet most people waste or squander the cash." auditing — the rigor behind this operation is crazy. leads to missed frequently school for children iv. do you know of a better way? leads to missed work and income b. leads to frequent illness / sometimes chronic, and death iii. i loved hearing that. basically it’s the ultimate "anti" ruthless capitalism. and homa bay regions. ...and more.

however, sgt kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by durham police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : "with dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. but after years fighting at the apex of the drug war, his conclusion—and that of other experienced officers who have chosen to speak out—must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that has been trashing communities around the world for decades. but the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault—which all go hand in hand with the drug trade. over the years writing about the drug trade, i've met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker—a series of almost addictive drug bust "hits" that perpetuate the game. when i went stop and searching in soho with one of the met police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, i was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. to the anti-drug teams bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as "police property"—objects that police could do with as they wished. one detective sergeant told bacon: "sometimes i think we're like those [japanese] soldiers in world war ii—you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over. yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes." he spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the uk and wrote about his experiences in taking care of business , published last month. despite all this, there was acceptance—often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints—that they were not waging a "war on drugs," but managing an unbeatable problem in order to "keep the public happy." it will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes," he says. i call up simon kempton, a police sergeant from dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the national board of the police federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. there are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers. "the logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery," says woods. woods' book will open the public's eyes to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world, and the lengths police will go to in order to disrupt it. good cop, bad war is the story of an undercover police officer, neil woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating britain's biggest drug gangs. but within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with. on the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target. expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition—even to their colleagues—is something of a risk in the black and white, "them and us" world of police culture. while policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, i believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime." the more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder." in 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: "it made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. the book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. one female drug cop i spoke to told me: "there are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people. fisher's solution is to take the portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. photo courtesy of neil woods i spoke to mike fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for britain's organized crime busting bureau, the national crime agency (nca). now, after having left the force, he is chairman of leap uk (law enforcement against prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials. "a lot of people say drug addicts and drug dealers are scum of the earth, but they don't know anything about them."  photo: andoni lubaki fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish.  photo: marco tulio valencia drug cops, who saw themselves as "elite crime fighters," had sufficient respect however for the the mr. bigs of the drug world. to gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall—so that's the exact position that university of sheffield criminologist dr. matthew bacon took. he agrees with woods—that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country—but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out. they saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a "good collar" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues. he asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the nca's annual report. even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs. surprisingly, he tells me around half of britain's elite drug detectives at nca have similar "liberal" attitudes to the drugs problem. but to what extent are woods and his colleagues at leap uk—and those currently employed in the police force—rare specimens? "law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the misuse of drugs act came into force in 1971," says fisher. we've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than canute stopping the waves. it's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed "junkies" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. it's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. "undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. british police officers reveal what they really think about the war on drugs  a met police officer with some confiscated drugs. another officer told him: "we've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. "i get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. "i can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day," he says. in the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up." when they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. i was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis." you have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you. these people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. but what about those drug cops working below nca level, in towns and cities across the uk? how thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? but it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide." "if someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. "i believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. ultimately, his experiences led woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the uk. drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. "if the nca stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing," he explained. the official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not." all that would happen is that dealing would be more open. behind every user and runner, there's a story," she said. "we are taking out the worst people in our society. i can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. "whenever we remove a big guy, someone else—usually a lieutenant—replaces him within days. "the idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. "ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments." only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting." undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. there are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. "they were made the scapegoat of the drug problem." "i say legalize the lot," one said. "you would see little change in the high street. "legalize it and tax it," said the other. this gave them a "righteousness" in their actions, observed bacon. "almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws," says bacon.  neil woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. as it is, drugs are freely available now. photo: tom johnson this post originally appeared on vice uk. society would not collapse.
for it to be considered kleptoparasitism, the biologist erika iyengar explains , the parasite has to steal food from the host, and the host has to suffer as consequence. but this is not the reason a seagull loitering at a food factory in gloucestershire, england, fell into a vat of it this past monday. gulls are what's known as "opportunistic kleptoparasites," meaning they don't derive 100 percent of their diets from heist but rather just steal when the opportunity arises. basically, the gulls have realized, why search for your own food when there's some perfectly good food in another animal's possession? seagulls are what biologists called kleptoparasites , animals that rob the food of other species. according to seabirds: feeding ecology and role in marine ecosystems, kleptoparasitism is a survival strategy that minimizes the energy expenditure needed to obtain food. and a big vat of tikka masala is an opportunity no gull can afford to miss. gulls and some other birds will steal food right from the clutches of other birds, mid-flight. (the people who were not able to eat that delicious spiced chicken because, gross, a bird was in it, definitely suffered.) this seagull fell into a vat of chicken tikka masala. birds that are kleptoparasites tend to have bigger brains than birds that live the straight and narrow. seabirds breaks down the percentage of which species of seabirds get their food from robbing. i think i can explain why chicken tikka masala is undoubtedly delicious. there are some, like the arctic skua (a.k.a. it looks like he’s trying to cosplay as an angry bird. the parasitic jaeger), that feast primarily on the food of others. and it's not just human food. and the birds can be damn cunning about it. they need to be clever to do so. perhaps you've seen photos of the bird, colored orange from his dip. (turmeric, a key ingredient in curry, contains a potent orange pigment.) but why?
morgan freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.appearing on late night with seth meyers , morgan freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.while the original title of stephen king’s novelladoesn’t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, morgan freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. the one thing morgan freeman still thinks is terrible about the shawshank redemption the one thing morgan freeman still thinks is terrible about the shawshank redemption by dirk libbey appearing on shawshank redemption was a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page. morgan freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has rita hayworth’s name, which is something, although it’s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.while we’ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for the shawshank redemption we do know that the title they chose didn’t help. while the original title of rita hayworth and shawshank redemption doesn’t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter than rita hayworth and shawshank redemption end up getting cut off. today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. morgan freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. while we’ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for shawshank redemption, making it one of the most popular films ever made. in fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? in the long run, however, fans find great movies and they eventually did find, making it one of the most popular films ever made. the original title [of stephen king's short story] was ...

he cried twice that day, once when i asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in angie’s murder, and a second time when michael usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary usry is making about this case. a new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our dna cbs news correspondent anne marie green writes about how she came across this story, and the angie dodge murder investigation, which she reported for "48 hours" in "the dna of a killer." i think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of dna databases, the lesson is this: when you trade your dna for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. after getting my dna report i learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your dna may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your dna profile to them. years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of angie dodge, police conducted a familial dna search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s dna. a little more searching and i stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, michael usry jr. a familial search conducted by idaho falls police landed usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his dna, without any explanation. both men said they knew nothing about the murder of angie dodge , both men had their dna tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. there is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. that search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of michael usry jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the angie dodge murder investigation. police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his dna to search new york state’s criminal database for a relative of his. how his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his dna to a public database, which was later purchased by ancestry.com. i first learned about the 20-year-old murder of angie dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my dna analyzed by one of those commercial dna databases. the infamous "grim sleeper," lonny franklin jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his dna had been uploaded to the california criminal database. as i talked with michael usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. chris tapp, serving time for the murder of idaho teen angie dodge, shows cbs news correspondent anne-marie green what his life is like inside the... a quick search of the phrase "familial dna" and i learned authorities in california had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your dna profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. the day both michael usry and i went to see chris tapp in prison, i was struck by how soft spoken and kind tapp was. after obtaining a search warrant for ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named michael usry sr. what if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking? the interview was conducted shortly before lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time tapp had heard her voice since the accident. then i heard that the new york city police department was trying to get permission to do something called a "familial dna" search. if they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer. despite what happened, michael usry’s father does not regret participating in a dna study, but rest assured that his son never will. tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. i was immediately struck by the fact that michael usry jr. and chris tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. i gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road. there was a man serving time for angie’s murder, christopher tapp, who usry believes is innocent. one told me the type of workout supplements i should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. it was an interview with tapp’s wife, lori, who tapp had met and married while in prison. there was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my dna. right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. in the video, lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. after i hung up the phone, i started researching angie dodge’s murder and the case against chris tapp. they had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. when cops built out his family tree they found usry had a son. i learned that authorities had never found tapp’s dna at the crime scene. a familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest. but i did wonder if i could learn anything more from the dna report. i tracked usry down on facebook and asked him to call me. there were no big revelations and, just as i suspected, i am not related to royalty. what if that company goes out of business and sells the database? that was the story i pitched to "48 hours" executive producer susan zirinsky. when we finally spoke, he told the whole story. cops tracked him down and began investigating. i probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. do the protections you have been promised still stand? when i got my results back i was not surprised. how safe is your dna? what does that mean?
here's the part of the uk that has the most sex according to researchers, the ideal number of people you sleep with, for both men and women to retain their interest, is three. the sun on sunday surveyed 3,000 people on how many sexual partners they have had, and the results are, in most cases a little more than three. people living in cardiff had the least number of average partners, with three, and liverpool had only five. despite the high number, millennials appear to be having less sex than the previous generation, because of societal pressures and living with parents. closely following the west midlands city, with an average of 46 different partners, is st albans, in hertfordshire, and dundee nabbed third place with 38 partners. any more than that, and interest seems to drop off. wolverampton wins the top prize, with residents claiming that they've had 48 lovers. each.
he had a vision for something that he could make with the ice and snow that would be much more interesting than your ordinary run of the mill snowman. when the east coast was hit with a major snowstorm, ice hockey player mitch fritz decided to take the opportunity to build something special. he started out by filling all of these bread tins with water and food colouring. he then left them out overnight during the snowstorm, so that they would freeze. using the snow as packing material to cement them together, he made this stunning colourful igloo. he places colored water in bread pans outside during a snowstorm. take a look at what he did! 3. what he makes is stunning! 2. 1.
six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer elijah price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults). nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of sam raimi’s spiderman films). admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal. the scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors. bizarro looks and acts like superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. two years after unbreakable was released, raimi’s first spider-man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. we see the reluctant hero, played here by bruce willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. it may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that m night shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. in today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s unbreakable as a bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. why unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie i n the superman comics there is a character called bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. and yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that unbreakable is the exact antithesis of marvel and dc’s current output. but while ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative "mr glass" is straight from the john doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, cgi skyscrapers reduced to cgi rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. the film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching cgi not once. the present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of unbreakable. it’s also significant that the other character at the heart of unbreakable is samuel l jackson’s villain. while today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. if heath ledger’s joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. instead, we see willis’ david dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. it is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie. a decade on, marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while dc having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. we get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by hollywood a-listers. for starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. "these are mediocre times, mrs dunn," jackson tells robin wright’s audrey dunn in unbreakable. remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of man of steel ? the basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. there’s a great seinfeld episode based on the character. he didn’t know the half of it. it’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint. there is no shouting. published 21 aug 2016 published 21 aug 2016 "people are starting to lose hope."

as quartz reports thursday, "around a third of all developed-country government debt—or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value—is now trading at negative yields," meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. as matt o'brien notes at the washington post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. it may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country. the fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. this is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. countries like germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it’s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. when long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. something crazy is happening in switzerland, and its a bad sign for the world economy harold cunningham/getty images investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the swiss for a half-century at a time. all of which is to say: today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two. even economically wounded spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. these days, things aren't so straightforward: the sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. it's like a bad financial-world play on a yakov smirnoff joke: in switzerland, lender pay you! so they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or swiss francs. last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation. meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort—you need to cover the cost of security and storage. and if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. fifteen-year german and japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. the world economy still feels shaky, especially after the brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. and in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. for one, they don't see many other safe options. (bond yields fall as prices rise.) why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? the most mind-blowing example of this trend is switzerland. so easy, even your great uncle mort can do it. other countries are getting nearly as good deals. jordan weissmann jordan weissmann is slate’s senior business and economics correspondent. then you get back interest payment. you buy a bond. this is remarkable.

"in order to make sure that everyone has a floor — something they can't fall below, that we end poverty once and for all — let's give everyone a check," the former president of the service employees international union said in a recent interview with cnbc's " "in order to make sure that everyone has a floor — something they can't fall below, that we end poverty once and for all — let's give everyone a check," the former president of the service employees international union said in a recent interview with cnbc's " power lunch ." economists at the libertarian think tank cato institute recently argued that the still, there is wide disagreement about how to alleviate poverty, whether the government should redistribute income to address it — or whether it's really a problem in the first place. © provided by cnbc still, there is wide disagreement about how to alleviate poverty, whether the government should redistribute income to address it — or whether it's really a problem in the first place. while the idea of a universal basic income (ubi) is not necessarily a new one, andy stern believes his plan is important now because of "tectonic shifts" in the labor market that will see more and more workers replaced by robots. there were 46.7 million people living in poverty in 2014, according to income inequality continues to be one of the urgent topics in the public discourse. why one man thinks the us government should pay citizens $1,000 a month one former union boss has a bold idea on how to ensure economic stability in the u.s. — give every citizen $1,000 a month. economists at the libertarian think tank cato institute recently argued that the income gap was being 'misperceived" by a range of factors that are being misinterpreted by the public. yet stern, who is a senior fellow at columbia university and author of "raising the floor," argues the debate is being shifted by concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence and the displacement of workers. the the world economic forum projects more than 5 million jobs in 15 leading countries will be lost by 2020, thanks to disruptive labor market changes, including the increased use of robots. "a tsunami of change may be coming and we would be crazy to not look at the warning signs and figure out a plan," said stern. there were 46.7 million people living in poverty in 2014, according to the latest data from u.s. census bureau . stern, however, is undeterred, and has an answer for those who are concerned about the cost to the government. income inequality continues to be one of the urgent topics in the public discourse. additionally, according to a 2013 oxford study, 47 percent of u.s. jobs were at risk of being automated in the next two decades. it was the first country to hold a referendum on the issue, but others including finland are examining similar plans. the idea was also the idea was also rejected in switzerland earlier this month, when voters decided against a basic income plan. the poverty threshold was $12,331 a year for an individual under 65 and $15,871 for a two-adult household during that time. that's the basis of how we can fund this kind of program," he said.

something tragic that involved his mother... hahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to walt and his family. hahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to walt and his family. the answer is actually tragic walt disney may no longer be with us, but he's left behind a legacy of films that have ultimately been with most of us since the time we were born. hahn went on to explain that this isn't a method disney created himself, but one that he borrowed from many of the fairy tales his movies were based on. don explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up. but regardless of the year they are released, almost every disney film has one thing in common – the main character almost never has a mother. "one reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and disney films are about growing up" says hahn. now some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all – like in aladdin. but even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. but that's not the only possible reason for the lack of motherhood in his movies. belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. for as long as i can remember, disney films have been a major part of my life. and let's face it – most disney movies are about growing up. well if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further. "bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. because longtime disney producer don hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind walt's method. now, i find myself venturing off into some of disney's newer films. something tragic that involved his mother... growing up, i constantly watched the classics with my family. ever wondered why disney characters never have mothers? and one theory behind it is quite sad! think about it! it's a story shorthand." but why? recall jasmine's dad the sultan? no mom. the little mermaid? no wifey. cinderella? pocahontas?

floating up to the surface some time after death, the sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. it looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the indian ocean. although the exact species of the whale hasn’t been declared, it’s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western australian coastline. now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of bunbury, western australia, and it’s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. the stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of california the other week. "when we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell," he told the west australian. what the heck was this smelly pink blob floating in the indian ocean? "its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up." gudkov andrey/shutterstock a non-deceased humpback whale. mark watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn’t be identified – at least at first. the sea is dark and full of terror. a non-deceased humpback whale. after drifting away from the carcass, watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. on occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury. "seeing it was great," watkins noted on facebook. "the smell, not so much." gudkov andrey/shutterstock clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry).
peter dinklage's voice-over work on this video game is pretty unbearable peter dinklage’s voice-over work in the upcoming shooter game "destiny" has not been well received. in response to the negative reception, bungie, the studio behind "destiny," and formerly "halo," has confirmed that the dialogue has been updated and will be fixed by the game’s sept. 9 release. according to re/code bungie has even offered fans a limited edition t-shirt sporting one of dinklage’s most poorly delivered lines: "the wizard came from the moon!" "every time he begins talking i’m pulled out of the game and reminded that, oh yeah, the guy who plays tyrion lannister isn’t particularly interested in convincing me to give a s**t about what’s happening around me." to be fair, dinklage’s work has been seen only in the game's "alpha" version, for early adopters. "he sounds like an actor unsure of his character, without a director to indicate who he’s supposed to be," writes a reviewer from kotaku. dinklage voices the artificial intelligence unit ghost, which follows the player’s character throughout the game, offering advice, commentary and history of the environment. unfortunately, many fans are less than thrilled with the results of the "game of thrones" actor’s voice work. watch the video above to see "destiny" gameplay footage featuring some of dinklage's terrible voice-overs. "we love that you can lean in and laugh with us," the developer wrote on its blog. on its blog, the developer told fans not to worry. check out the two videos below for even more cringe-worthy footage. "destiny" will be available on ps3, ps4, xbox 360 and xbox one. "funny thing about alpha builds...they’re not done. bungie wrote. please pardon our moon dust!"
yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when sony was the altruistic heroes of the xbox drm meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming pc. if that’s the case, it will be hard to take the first steps, but sony could be trailblazing, and that’s never easy to do with the gaming crowd. the fact that the playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an n64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op perfect dark. reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the playstation 4 the playstation 4.5, or possibly playstation 4k thanks to its upgraded gpu which will be used for 4k visuals and the fancy playstation vr headset. if we’re going to go forward with anything, like i said, i want it to be a really substantial change for people–an upgrade." speaking after microsoft’s build 2016 keynote address, xbox head phil spencer told gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the xbox one. one in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won’t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete. if we’re going to move forward, i want to move forward in big numbers. of course, this could be the first step in a pc-ified home-gaming experience. "i’m not a big fan of xbox one and a half. the hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named nintendo, or so it once seemed. will xbox one be getting playstation 4.5 style upgrades? it performs, it’s reliable, the servers are doing well. needless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren’t impressed. for us, our box is doing well. console wars never change.

the cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it’s been extended to the entire year so, looking ahead, chase freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (july 1 to september 30), and again during the fourth quarter (october 1 to december 31). the new visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. what’s more, costco now accepts any visa card, so you don’t need to use the one the retailer sent as a replacement for the old amex card. the warehouse retailer’s 16-year partnership with has expired, and as of june 20 members who had costco amex cards should switch over to the new costco visa anywhere card. for instance, the chase freedom visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as costco, bj’s, and sam’s club. note that with the chase freedom card, the cash back is plain old cash back and does not have to be redeemed at costco. in the case of both of the new and old costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at costco. costco members who have costco amex accounts should have already been sent new costco visa cards in the mail automatically. the old costco amex card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually. costco is making a big change today that shoppers need to know about a huge change that’s been months in the making is officially taking place today at . and there may be times when you probably should use a non-costco visa card for your costco purchases. in many ways, the card change works to the benefit of costco members. is now the only credit card accepted at costco. after customers hit the cap, the bonus goes back to only 1%. finance costco costco costco (debit cards, ebt cards, and cash are still accepted as payment too.)
when i was in the thousands i was in a loss for words and i had tears running down my face because i've never had that sort of reaction from that many people loving me and wanting the best for me. according to a reddit ama he held after his story's release on youtube, it took worrall about a month to master gameplay with the jouse. something unexpected gave this paralyzed man his life back after waking up almost entirely paralyzed in the hospital about 20 years ago, ken worrall asked to be disconnected from his life-giving machines. "i am ready to talk to the world about me, my injury and how i live positive every day," he wrote on reddit. by placing the jouse in in his mouth and puffing it, he is able to right-click; by "sipping," he can left-click. when asked during his reddit ama how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, "maybe thirty?... according to an interview with ctv news, one of his viewers recently wrote him a letter, saying, "i was about to shoot myself." he's already fundraising so that he can attend blizzcon, a gaming convention in california, and is considering becoming a motivational speaker. but, as he explains in the youtube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose. worrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. some time later, he was introduced to the jouse, a mouth-operable mouse that made computer use accessible. known online as "no hands ken," worrall streams his play live to a mass audience via twitch. and now hundreds of thousands of people have seen him play. the man who had considered disconnecting is now saving others' lives. an incorrectly fastened air duct fell and hit a pair of two-by-fours; worrall's helmet broke under the impact. blinking in a yes-or-no binary code was initially his sole form of communication. it's clear he's off to a strong start. his father persuaded him to give it time. worrall was on a windy construction site when his accident occurred. he woke up able to move only his eyes. worrall began playing "diablo," and he was hooked. worrall has big plans for his future. it made me feel incredible."
according to barcroft tv, it was only when a picture of howard went viral on facebook last april that howard decided to embrace the accidental fame. it is his trademark look," howard says as he walks the streets of hong kong, capturing the attention of confused onlookers. it is great being kim jong un, but it is always nice to go back home and just be myself," he added. pretending to be a dictator has its dangers though, and barcroft tv notes that howard's surname is kept secret for fear of north korean reprisals. it freaks people out that they can't believe the dictator is in this part of the world. after years of being a musician, 34-year-old howard decided it was time to take a different career path that utilized his looks. the page boasts that he is "the closest thing you get to the 'dear leader' without actually going to north korea." is that kim jong un walking the streets of hong kong? he then capitalized on his physique by setting up a facebook page to advertise his services as an impersonator. "it is fun to play kim jong un because it freaks people out. he became the world's first professional kim jong un impersonator. "the key to becoming him is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. howard has been told he resembles the infamous dictator since 2011, when kim took power. in full makeup, hair and suit, the two are almost indistinguishable. no, he did not become a model.
"only 1 participant out of 85 correctly recalled the apple logo, and fewer than half of all participants correctly identified the logo," the researchers wrote. more than half of the 85 students who took this test as part of research conducted by a team from university of california, los angeles, got it wrong. then they had to choose from a selection of altered logos like the ones in the quiz you just took. adam blake and his colleagues asked the students to first draw the logo from memory (you can see some of their attempts above). do you know what the apple logo actually looks like? 4. participants also had to rate how confident they were that they would get it right.
"they attempted to work through these issues with jail staff, but now are forced to evaluate other viable options to protect their rights as citizens who stand accused with the weight of the government against them,'' ammon bundy's lawyer, mike arnold, wrote in a report on jail conditions filed in court tuesday, according to the paper. in response, the multnomah county sheriff's office said the brothers and their co-defendants could have ipads in their jail cells, as long as their lawyers preload the devices with the discovery documents and videos needed to prepare for trial, the newspaper reported. the leader of the armed group that took over a federal wildlife reserve in oregon last january is complaining about what he says is a big injustice: the lack of internet access inside his jail cell. ammon bundy and his brother ryan bundy have requested internet access in jail to help them prepare for a sept. 7 federal trial, the oregonian reported. the bundy brothers are arguing that they cannot sufficiently prepare for their sept. 7 trial, alleging a violation of their civil rights, according to the newspaper. oregon militia leader has jail complaints © rick bowmer/ap ammon bundy, center, one of the sons of nevada rancher cliven bundy, arrives for a news conference at malheur national wildlife refuge on jan. 6, 2016, near burns, ore. the two brothers are among 26 defendants indicted on federal conspiracy and weapons charges related to the 41-day armed takeover of the malheur national wildlife refuge in eastern oregon. "all of my first amendment rights are being violated...i am not allowed to see my brother and move about....this violates my freedom of assembly...my second amendment rights are being violated. bundy and his co-defendants also have complained about not having the opportunity to see one another to discuss trial strategies and pray together. but ammon bundy's lawyer wrote in a court document last week that such an arrangement wouldn't work because the case discovery program is web-based. the occupation began jan. 2, with bundy and others demanding the federal government turn public lands over to local control. "my right to live is being violated,'' defendant ryan bundy wrote. i never waived that right.''
quirk added that her hands have been healing well — she has a full range of motion, and most of the feeling in her fingers is back. she stayed in the hospital the next few days with people whom she described on imgur as "insanely cool nurses and doctors" and even remarked at the coincidence that the specialist treating her was named dr. freezin. she said she has a simple but effective philosophy on staying upbeat in the worst situations: "basically, try to find the shit that makes you happy, especially when everything seems miserable." in the midst of the canadian winter she found herself getting tired, a symptom of hypothermia, and fell asleep outside a nursing home. this is the horrifying thing that happens to your hands when you fall asleep outside in winter man, this sucks. quirk said that after having a good deal to drink one night, she got separated from her friends with no phone, no money, and no sense of direction. the healing process was tough for her, but quirk said it was little things that helped her maintain a positive outlook. the doctor told her that the extent of her injuries ranged from mild to third- and fourth-degree frostbite. the doctor explained the blistering process to her, and said he would pop her blisters when the time came. this photo was taken about 20 minutes after she was discovered, with her hands already exhibiting symptoms of frostbite. emma loves traveling, so a couple of weeks ago was exploring saskatchewan, the part of canada where her boyfriend grew up. and i think it was just a constant focus on the good bits that keeps me upbeat." quirk, who works at a liquor store, described the agony of dealing with frostbitten fingers to buzzfeed news. some staff members found her outside, and rushed her to the hospital. her prognosis is good, she said: "by all accounts of medical professionals, my fingers are remaining attached!" like trying to teach my boyfriend how to brush my hair, or getting him to do my makeup. the medication made me sick, and the prospect of losing your fingers never disappears. this was the biggest point her fingers reached in the process. from the second i was told it lingered on my brain."

as already mentioned above, whitewashing has been happening for years in hollywood, but as already mentioned above, whitewashing has been happening for years in hollywood, but disney has a long tradition of promoting diversity , not only in its offices but in movies as well . the movie industry seems to remain completely deaf to the constant criticism regarding the movie industry seems to remain completely deaf to the constant criticism regarding sexual objectification ageism , and its lack of diversity (not just racial, but gender diversity as well). even more worrying is the fact that bogus news like such are highly believable – and why wouldn’t they be when we’ve had white actors play everything from asian to black characters. and, probably more importantly, continue to participate in the conversation about this, because nothing will change if we don’t try changing it, now is it. evidently, people are concerned about the whitewashing trend sneaking into disney and stealing what could potentially be a name-making role from diverse actors. back in april, fans launched an online petition that urges people to "tell disney you don’t want a whitewashed mulan." the latest addition to this troubling trend – the rumor that actress jennifer lawrence is being cast as mulan in a disney reboot. back in april, disney’s remake ofmulanhas been causing some waves since the very first day. disney’s remake of mulan has been causing some waves since the very first day. yes, we’re talking about whitewashing , a yes, we’re talking about, a casting practice that gives historically nonwhite character roles to white actors. it also followed with a "breaking update" that hollywood’s sugar boy zac effron will be joining lawrence "in the live-action mulan remake as li shang!" and even if it’s not true, it might only be not true... for now. well, first of all it seems like you could go ahead and sign the petition. the latter is largely connected to another phenomenon that – albeit prevalent for years – has been recently brought to the attention of the masses. yet it seems like the strategy of learning from personal mistakes doesn’t apply to hollywood, which is really a shame. examples include leonardo dicaprio being cast as persian poet rumi , tilda swinton as tibetan monk the ancient one, and so on and on... here’s why you shouldn’t freak out about the ‘j law cast as mulan’ news... it’s already been signed by more than 88,000 supporters, but still needs a little bit to hit the 90,000 signatures goal. so what can we do to change that? the rumor was released by a fake (fake, people!) the "news" quickly caused an outrage among many online users. @unreel_news .
"the stars were aligned as far as these people being able to find the young lady at the time they did; to be able to get that call out as quickly as they did; to have the knowledge, skill and training to do initial cpr," john willcox of the squamish search and rescue told cbc news. "as far as i know, this is the longest duration of cpr ever performed in north america for this condition, probably any condition, with a good outcome," dr. doug brown, a volunteer with squamish search and rescue and an er doctor who has researched accidental hypothermia, told global news. tree well for more than seven hours is expected to make a full recovery, thanks to a fortuitous chain of events — including a record-breaking amount of cpr. tink newman, an sfu student and former skeleton athlete, received four continuous hours of cpr after being pulled from a tree well. student, was apparently heard leaving the wax at elfin lakes shelter around 2 a.m. by guests who thought she was going to use the bathroom, squamish search and rescue manager john howe told pique. newman's parents, john and ernestine, told global news that she was only discovered because her backpack had fallen near the tree well. newman is in stable condition in hospital and is expected to fully recover from the incident, reported cbc. her six rescuers included a retired paramedic and a nurse who were able to start performing cpr right away, howe told pique. newman was transferred by helicopter to the vancouver general hospital, which has a special device called an ecmo that helped raise her body temperature, said global. christine "tink" newman, 24, was unconscious and hypothermic when she was found on the morning of april 1 in garibaldi park near whistler, reported pique newsmagazine. record-breaking cpr saved this woman a snowshoer who fell and was stuck in a b.c. newman is a former skeleton athlete who is studying interactive arts and technology and business entrepreneurship at simon fraser university, according to several online profiles. those members then continued the emergency procedure, meaning in total, newman received about four continuous hours of cpr. her friends, who were snowshoeing the next morning, spotted it and pulled her out. she was stuck there overnight for more than seven hours. she's expected to make a full recovery. she's also ceo of a startup called foodavinci, a food website. they took turns until search and rescue arrived. newman, a b.c.
finding out rather too much about strangers' sex lives was a common complaint, with one worker complaining about guests who call staff to the room, and then make them wait outside while they get intimate. others complained of wedding parties trashing their hotel rooms, while one claimed a guess had drunk from the mini bar and then refilled the bottles with their urine. another worker reported being called to men's rooms who then perform a sex act in front of them, while others insist on answer the door naked. one eyebrow-raising tale came from someone who had worked at a hotel in gran canaria last summer and witnessed numerous parents forgetting to collect their children from the kids club because they were drunk. hotel staff reveal guests' most gruesome habits with thousands of guests passing through their rooms every year, it's no wonder hotel staff have some choice tales to tell. after being asked what guests do to get under their skin, hotel workers made some very candid confessions, involving used condoms being discarded under beds and women flashing the porter instead of giving a tip. and some unfortunate workers have been forced to put up with some very unpleasant behaviour, according to a new reddit discussion. people complaining about the slightest thing to get a discount was another particular bugbear.

during a concert celebrating his 50 years in music, mexican crooner josé josé tried to greet a fan at the side of the stage when he suddenly fell nearly five feet into the crowd. the crooner celebrated the event with some 4,000 fans in a white suit, but the mood turned ominous when the star unexpectedly took a tumble off the stage. (watch the video of the fall above) known as the "prince of the songs," josé josé observed the milestone year in his career with a concert in mexico city last friday. once the singer was back on his feet, the crowd began shouting: "josé josé lives! once back on stage, the star didn’t hesitate to laugh and tell the audience "i didn’t plan to fall tonight." the special occasion was also the first time the 64-year-old singer performed after undergoing surgery for an hernia in the groin, according to mexican newspaper el universal. legendary mexican singer falls off stage during anniversary concert it only took one misstep to come tumbling down. fortunately, the singer was not injured during the incident and even poked fun at himself. josé josé lives!"
"we call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people," lidy nacpil, director at jubilee south asia pacific movement on debt and development, said in a statement. the environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. the tool’s calculations are based on the latest international panel on climate change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees celsius by 2025. kartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in u.n. climate talks of what each country should do. the u.s. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the stockholm environment institute, friends of the earth, and jubilee south asia pacific movement for debt and development. that means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid. here’s how much every country would have to pay to stop climate change what would it cost to avoid a climate disaster that would affect poor countries the most? sivan kartha, a senior scientist at stockholm environment institute, said that ipcc’s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world’s climate. "that’s why they are focused on making sure the u.n. green climate fund is not established in a way that makes it easy for big multinational corporations to capture the finance there, for example." alex rafalowicz, a fellow at the washington-based institute for governance and sustainable development, said the creation of a transparent u.n. green climate fund is paramount to the plan. "based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world. worldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check. to be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. "the organizing of democratic, accessible, and people-first financing systems is a core part of many organizations’ demands," rafalowicz wrote in an email. it may be hard to do, but it’s dramatically easier than surviving 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming," kartha said. but how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered? the first scientific attempt to calculate each country’s "fair share" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population. that’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change." for the united states, the bill comes to $634 billion owed to developing nations. "it’s not just a question of being fair. that even includes nations such as china, now the world’s largest carbon emitter. how did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? these deep cuts have to happen. it’s about being realistic.
california attorney general kamala harris became the first black woman elected to the u.s. senate from the golden state; ilhan omar became the first somali-american lawmaker in the u.s. with her election to the minnesota legislature; catherine cortez masto became the first latina senator in history when she won her u.s. senate bid in nevada; and pramila jayapal became the first indian-american congresswoman with her victory in washington state. in addition to obama's trip, cuba and the u.s. have both taken steps since 2014 to end decades of hostility by opening embassies, restoring commercial flights and negotiating agreements on a range of issues — including the environment, law enforcement and communications. as legend has it, the team was cursed in 1945 when tavern-owner william "billy goat" sianis was kicked out of game 4 of the cubs' world series game against the detroit tigers for bringing his smelly billy goat, murphy. for most people, any bad day can be made slightly brighter by the mere thought that "hamilton: an american musical" is out there and might, one day, be enjoyed by you again or for the very first time. president obama made history in march when he became the first u.s. leader to visit cuba in 88 years, culminating 15 months' worth of effort to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two countries. on his way out, sianis is reputed to have declared, "them cubs, they ain't gonna win no more," thus spawning the so-called curse of the billy goat that lasted seven decades. yet amid the bad, the ugly and the end of brangelina, there was still some good you might have missed while you were standing in your room crying to joni mitchell. few albums in history have managed to be as simultaneously vulnerable and powerful as "lemonade" — beyonce's sixth solo record that laid bare an important slice of black womanhood. the international union for conservation of nature, a leading environmental group, said in a report this fall that the giant panda is now classified as a "vulnerable" species, rather than "endangered." no matter what team you root for, it was hard not celebrate alongside the chicago cubs after they won their first world series in 108 years. but it wasn't the only great album of 2016: frank ocean, a tribe called quest and beyonce's own sister, solange, also created stunning music this year. the unemployment rate in november fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest in nine years, the labor department said earlier this month. according to the group, the wild panda population jumped to 1,864 in 2014 — up from 1,596 in 2004 — marking a significant achievement for chinese agencies working to enforce poaching bans and expand forest reserves. indeed, "lemonade" was an artistic feat so monumental, it helped ease the pain inflicted by the deaths of some of music's greatest legends. but the most moving moment of the ceremony came when show creator lin-manuel miranda delivered his emotional "love is love is love" speech while accepting the award for best score. it was her near-perfect performance at the olympics, however — which netted four golds and a bronze — that cemented her legacy as the greatest female gymnast who ever lived. to compare: when president obama took office in 2009, the unemployment rate was at 7.8 percent. there is looming uncertainty, however, as to whether president-elect donald trump will maintain warmer relations with the communist country once he takes office. several women of color made political history last month when they were elected to prominent leadership positions within their respective states. in june, the hip-hip broadway sensation took home 11 tony awards — including best musical, the biggest prize of all. here is the year that was in good news. here are eight good things that happened in 2016 let's be honest: 2016 was rough. hours earlier, a lone gunman had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in orlando. it wasn't all bad! with 14 total world championship medals, 19-year-old simon biles arrived in rio already a star.
malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-saharan africa). we all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant hgbs, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. the good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too. today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet. our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. so what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of north europeans. primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. as expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (caucasians). genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the black sea region. changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in adhd and blue eyes. for whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist. answer by matan shelomi, organismic and evolutionary biologist, on quora: all life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesn't stop. another famous example is hgbs (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. more and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. originally appeared on quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. how will humans look 10,000-100,000 years from now? who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence? what will humans look like 100,000 years from now? thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. more questions: this question originally appeared on quora. since we became homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes. this question originally appeared on quora. unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. you can follow quora on twitter, facebook, and google+. they are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. as living things, humans are still evolving. ask a question, get a great answer. our mouths are changing, too. darwin's theory of natural selection evolves. yes, blue eyes. more questions: learn from experts and access insider knowledge. actually, yes.
there was danger to her life due to an abnormality in the foetus coming to rescue to a 24-week pregnant woman facing danger to her life due to an abnormality in the foetus, the supreme court on monday granted her permission to terminate her pregnancy. the apex court had appointed the board of seven senior doctors to conduct a medical examination of the lady and directed it to file a report about her "condition and advisability of permitting a medical termination of pregnancy". the court said that it was not necessary to go into "medical and medico-legal aspect of the identity of the foetus and the matter is to be decided from the standpoint of the petitioner to preserve her life". the court had allowed her to abort on the basis of a medical report from kem hospital which said that foetus had serious abnormalities with slim chances of surviving the full term. on the basis board's suggestion, the bench allowed the lady to undergo an abortion and directed that the termination would be done under the supervision of the board. the bench allowed a plea of a mumbai-based 22-year-old woman to terminate her pregnancy after taking into account her medical report which of a team of seven doctors of king edward memorial(kem) hospital in mumbai. the law permits a woman to terminate her pregnancy till 20 weeks if two registered practitioners express the unanimous opinion that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or the foetus has severe abnormalities. the report says that the there was very little chance of survival of the foetus and the lady's life would be engendered if it was not aborted. "in these circumstances, we consider it appropriate and in the interest of justice, particularly the right of the petitioner to preserve her life, that she be allowed to undergo the termination of pregnancy. the woman approached the court after doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy as it was not allowed under the medical termination of pregnancy act, 1971. in july last year, the court had allowed a rape survivor's distress plea to abort her 24-week pregnancy citing serious abnormalities with the foetus. this is the third incident in recent years when the apex court has allowed women to abort beyond the period prescribed by law. complying with its order, the board filed a report and favoured medical termination of the pregnancy. further, the termination shall be supervised by the same medical board," the bench said. it said that the foetus was detected with anencephaly, a serious defect where parts of the skull are not adequately developed. the termination shall be done by the doctors of kem hospital. equally, rather more important, the continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the physical and mental health of the petitioner". the court said, "the foetus is not compatible with living outside the uterus. originally published in the times of india just in just in just in in other words, the foetus would not be able to survive.
these are the five latest polls rcp used to calculate trump’s narrow lead: abc news/washington post: trump leads by 2 percentage points nbc news/wall street journal: clinton leads by 3 percentage points rasmussen reports: trump leads by 5 percentage points fox news: trump leads by 3 percentage points cbs news/new york times: clinton leads by 6 percentage points these polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion. although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by nbc/wsj and fox news only spoke to registered voters, rasmussen interviewed "likely voters", while the abc news/washington post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters). just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the white house. although this might be the first time that trump has come out on top in the rcp polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions – in september and december of last year. that’s problematic in itself; this election can’t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate’s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the white house. democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. to understand what will happen when the country votes this november, pundits would do better to look at the electoral map, demographics and – most importantly of all – listen to the concerns of voters. part of the reason why they didn’t panic before was a belief that measuring american public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. for those concerned about the prospect of a trump victory, it’s been time to panic for a while – zooming out from a single statistic shows it. the polling data site realclearpolitics (rcp) takes an average of national polls that ask americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). so far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a trump win. that means that trump’s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are "safe" – based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. that gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at rcp) to conclude "it’s probably time to panic". perhaps rasmussen reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in iowa – we just don’t know. on sunday, rcp updated their numbers to show that trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of clinton. the polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. polling on a pedestal all that said, the rcp polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be. take the abc news/washington post poll for example – those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. for the first time, republican donald trump seems to have edged ahead of democrat hillary clinton in presidential polling. each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate’s support is distributed throughout the country. since september, clinton’s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. there’s another, much bigger problem with the rcp average, though: it’s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might "swing" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally – states like arizona, florida, north carolina, ohio and west virginia. two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in spanish and english – it seems that the others did not. all polls claim to speak to a "nationally representative" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional democratic strength in populous states such as new york, new jersey, illinois and california. in other words, there have been many other periods when trump’s opponents should have been worrying before now. once you peek under the hood, you’ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings. in 2008, barack obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. or it could be that hillary clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points. donald trump takes poll lead over hillary clinton – is it time to panic? rcp always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. they’re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. what does it mean and should those opposed to trump be worried? the alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift. polling is far from perfect. november is still six months away. because people change their minds. but only just. methodologies matter. why? delayed panic? languages matter too. i’d disagree.
the team, led by sascha usenko, a environmental scientist at baylor university in waco, texas, extracted an earplug from a blue whale (balaenoptera musculus) killed in a collision with a ship off the coast of santa barbara, california, in 2007 and found it had come into contact with several organic pollutants and contained high levels of the stress hormone cortisol as it reached sexual maturity. "it’s difficult to recover time-specific information on chemical exposure for almost any animal," says stephen trumble, a biologist also at baylor and a co-author of the study, published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week. exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year — and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact — suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing. "some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years," says usenko. (michelle berman-kowalewskic, ph.d., santa barbara museum of natural history, santa barbara, calif.) usenko and his team are now hoping to investigate that question by analysing some of the 1,000 or more whale specimens in museums worldwide. wax inside a whale’s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal’s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life, researchers have found. the research is "exciting", says jeremy goldbogen, a marine biologist at cascadia research collective in olympia, washington, but "the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study." "if we can look at individuals that lived in an environment without some of the stresses we see now, then we could tease out the causes of the cortisol increase," he says. but it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise. decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000–12,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. but it also records time — similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. the peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. the whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study. during his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. chemical signatures usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. in baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death. whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. mercury — which can cause brain damage — spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years. over the whale’s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. the male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study. but analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted. that is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world’s largest inhabitant. once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. this story originally appeared in nature news. can "wax" help save endangered mammals?
a temple in mussoorie did something that helps save water without breaking tradition mussoorie may be a picturesque town of himachal pradesh but like many places in the country, it too grapples with severe water crisis. whatever may be the efforts of the government to tackle the crisis, a famous temple in the town decided to do something that is worth a standing ovation. also see download our android app and stay up-to-date the report says that at the start of the summer season – when water scarcity is particularly severe – the temple bought two dozen small vessels. according to this report in the toi, the temple officials decided to replace all the larger vessels with those of smaller sizes. "symbolic gestures like these help spread awareness of the need for water conservation," the report quotes an environmentalist as saying. the devotees continue to follow rituals and traditions, and the temple has sent out a strong message in water conservation. and this is what gave the temple authorities an idea to help save water without breaking tradition. as is tradition, people pour water over the lingam with vessels made from copper of various sizes. the town needs around 14.5 million litres per day but gets only about half of it from local springs and brooklets. thronged by scores of devotees all through the year, the temple is frequented by many shiva bhakts. they are gradually phasing out all the big and medium size vessels. sanatan dharma mandir is one of the oldest temples of mussoorie. the result is that everyone is happy, including environmentalists.
the queen had a brilliant response when a tourist asked her if she'd met the queen the queen's former protection officer remembers bumping into tourists during a walk in balmoral  even queen elizabeth ii can occasionally walk among the public and avoid detection, at least according to an account from her former protection officer richard griffin. mr griffin recalled a time when the monarch was approached by a group of american tourists while on a walk near the balmoral estate in aberdeenshire at a recent talk, according to the times. the group asked the queen, who was wearing a headscarf and tweed coat, if she lived in the area, to which she responded simply by saying she had a house close-by. a spokesperson for kensington palace told the independent mr griffin worked closely with the queen as a protection officer for over 30 years. balmoral castle and estate was purchased by queen victoria and passed down to members of the royal family. the grounds are opened to the public from may to july each year. the group were still none the wiser and left without realising whose company they had just shared. "no," she apparently replied, before pointing at the policeman and adding: "but he has." "have you ever met the queen?" they asked.
it's not the first time the end of a radiohead video has featured indecipherable speech: the video for "just" does something similar. earlier this morning, radiohead teased their second new video in the space of a week, following tuesday's "burn the witch." the follow-up to 2011's the king of limbs is out digitally this sunday, may 8, at 7 p.m. uk time (2 p.m. eastern time), and physically june 17. guitarist jonny greenwood has spent much of his time between radiohead projects collaborating with anderson, scoring the director's films inherent vice, the master, and there will be blood. directed by paul thomas anderson, it features thom yorke, looking unsettled, opening lots of doors that lead to various locations, including a hospital, a laundromat, and a grocery store. finally: @radiohead have announced their new album release date at long last, it's here: radiohead have finally announced their ninth album. read "decoding the politics in radiohead's 'burn the witch' video" on the pitch. read "19 unreleased radiohead songs that could be on their next album" on the pitch. at the end of the video, yorke says something indecipherable. when the audio is isolated, reversed, and sped up, it appears he says something like "every minute, half of my love." inherent vice featured "spooks," a song written by radiohead and performed by supergrass. most recently, anderson directed a documentary based around greenwood's album with israeli composer shye ben tzur, junun. now, they've shared the clip for new single "daydreaming" in full. listen to that isolated audio here.

but if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. if you say, yes, "potter" was the biggest thing that i'm ever going to do and i'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. and i think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and i'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because i feel like i've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves. when you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck. what daniel radcliffe thinks of the "harry potter" spinoff there's little doubt that if daniel radcliffe were a rock musician, his current press tour for "kill your darlings" would have a title like "the moving on tour '13" or "harry in the rearview mirror." and i think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. that's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. so, yeah, i still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. and one of the things i think people will like about this film that i think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear "1940s beat poet historical drama," you sort of think, oh, that sounds quite dry. so there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new "star wars" movie. i remember people talking about "lord of the rings" and "potter" would be like "franchises" that's the first time i remember ... last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched "star wars." here's your for instance: in "kill your darlings," radcliffe plays a young allen ginsberg, who, at the outset of the beat generation, finds his friend, lucien carr (dane dehaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. yes, daniel radcliffe is no longer harry potter -- as a recent new york times magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what's interesting about radcliffe (great, even) is that he's not anti-harry potter. "the woman in black" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than harry that people were like, "oh, he's just trying to shock us." even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. "the woman in black" felt like its narrative was basically, "here's daniel radcliffe's first post-potter role," and now, with these, people have moved on. but, you know, i think that's what i liked about potter and that's what i'm still very proud of about potter. i think the reason i'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. not only do you have "kill your darlings" coming out this year, but you also starred in the toronto international film festival debuts, "horns" and "the f word." i may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff i see when i see that that's very reminiscent of harry. and i imagine that has given her a confidence of, "oh, ok, now that i stepped away from it, i can actually go back to it with confidence." and you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, "oh, i want to do what they're doing. that's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, "wow." like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like "the f word" and "kill your darlings." i don't think you can make a movie about the beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time. because i was kind of like, "ok, yeah, she's gone off and had 'casual vacancy' and then done the robert galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. but i do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything i've done before. there was at least one guy, digby milner, who worked on all the "potters" who had also worked on "star wars," the originals. "kill your darlings" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known. because, when i was growing up, i don't remember people talking about franchises before i was in one. i have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. when i pointed out that the ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, radcliffe defended the "harry potter" franchise. [director] john krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person's name, but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university. allen ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to. lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. what was your reaction when you heard j.k. rowling was revisiting the "harry potter" universe with "fantastic beasts & where to find them"? but i definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. but it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. that lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic. and i think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the "potter" world. this might be a bad comparison, but it's got a superhero origin story feel to it, only with writers. and it is kind of amazing because "star wars," the originals, were made in england as well. and the first time we see allen's name in the film is on his university application. i don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. and the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. and you're playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes. i just think i've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. the 24-year-old may be moving on from hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from. and he will be working on new "star wars" at leavesdon as well. i only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last "potter." when you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like aaron johnson or eddie redmayne or ben whishaw or james mcavoy. it's not easy to redefine yourself from harry potter, but it appears it's happening. but it's actually a lot of fun as well. i think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. that's all they do at leavesdon, apparently, is franchises [laughs]. i mean, i didn't know the story at all. it kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. and, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. i'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. i want to have loads of different parts as well." and i just have such fun doing my job, as well. but, i think with jo, i wasn't really surprised. you have to catch up before "episode vii" comes out. and i think it will be really good. so it builds up this desire to get out there. like when we're introduced to jack kerouac, it felt dramatic. i really wasn't aware of it. she definitely doesn't need the money. i had never heard her say "no." because "star wars" is filming in leavesden. oh, i've said that a lot. she doesn't need the money. yeah, i know what you mean. i think that's a really astute observation. i think that's completely true. let's not tell anyone that. so, it came very soon after. mike ryan is senior writer for huffington post entertainment. i know i do. you can contact him directly on twitter. it's come full circle. well, except for "the phantom menace." were you surprised? [laughs] yes. i know! yes. absolutely.

vroman, 34, was a star player for iowa state before being drafted in the second round by the chicago bulls in 2004. this is a good example of how fucking worthless our media is, these idiots have been saying my friend died in a car accident june 30, 2015 vroman, 34, was a star player for iowa state before being drafted in the second round by the chicago bulls in 2004. jackson vroman, the former nba player who was found dead at his los angeles home monday morning, drowned in his pool after tripping and hitting his head, according to vroman’s close friend, the instagram celebrity dan bilzerian. after two nba seasons with the phoenix suns and new orleans hornets, vroman played in south korea, spain, lithuania, and puerto rico before retiring in 2014. former nba player reportedly drowns after tripping and hitting his head near his pool. initial reports, including a tweet from the lebanese national basketball team, claimed, incorrectly apparently, that vroman died in a car accident. an autopsy is scheduled for later in the week, according to the des moines register.
gulag archipelago by aleksandr solzhenitsyn hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, gulag archipelago is the first-person account of soviet dissident aleksandr solzhenitsyn’s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the russian gulags for criticizing stalin and the soviet communist system in his private letters. hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, gulag archipelago is the first-person account of soviet dissident aleksandr solzhenitsyn’s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the russian gulags for criticizing stalin and the soviet communist system in his private letters. a staunch defender of the classical "canon" of great works every thinking person must read, bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students’ understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds western civilization. as the populist-conservative movement continues to grow and expand in the age of president trump, a new generation of energized voters and young people will do well to arm themselves with the intellectual firepower of the giants upon whose shoulders today’s movement rests. one of america’s most lucid conservative economists, sowell’s book draws upon everything from rousseau to hobbes to adam smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do. any nobel prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: "if you put the federal government in charge of the sahara desert, in 5 years there’d be a shortage of sand." hayek in the age of bernie sanders, today’s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read friedrich hayek’s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, the road to serfdom. a choice not an echo by phyllis schlafly the late great matriarch of modern conservatism, phyllis schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. one of america’s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, richard weaver erected an intellectual fortress around absolute truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil. a member of the austrian school of economics and a winner of the nobel prize in economics, hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism’s conceits. the original anti-establishment crusader, schlafly’s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the republican party’s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for barry goldwater’s nomination. the closing of the american mind by allan bloom long before anti-milo rioters sparked violence at uc berkeley, a university of chicago professor named allan bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. but a conflict of visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies—and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. ideas have consequences by richard weaver originally published in 1948, ideas have consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the left harnessed those forces to undermine western civilization. the tip of her intellectual spear, a choice not an echo, reshaped the contours of american conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. a winner of the nobel prize in literature, solzhenitsyn’s ability to combine lyrical prose with piercing reportage of communism’s moral horrors are virtually without equal. a conflict of visions by thomas sowell there are no "bad" thomas sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. as he put it elsewhere: "a claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers." in addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. here, then, are seven conservative classics that should be on every american’s bookshelf: 1. capitalism and freedom by milton friedman nobel prize-winning economist milton friedman redefined the field of economics. how many of these do you have on your shelf? 5. the road to serfdom by f.a. 7. 6. 2. 4. 3.
mit researches can read a book without opening the cover researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) have developed a prototype imaging system that’s able to read pages of a book without opening it. the project led barmak heshmat, a present-day research scientist at mit’s media lab, to question just how deep one could look through a closed book using terahertz waves. a decade ago, a group at mit demonstrated the ability to look through a sealed envelope using terahertz waves – the band of electromagnetic radiation between microwaves and infrared light. in terms of practicality, the team says the technique could be used to study ancient books that are so fragile that they can’t be opened without risk of destroying their contents. as technology continues to advance, the team no doubt hopes to be able to peer deeper into a book without opening it. working closely with researchers from georgia tech, heshmat and company have demonstrated the ability to identify letters up to nine pages deep. a paper on the matter, terahertz time-gated spectral imaging for content extraction through layered structures, has been published in nature communications for those interested in learning more. found is a techspot feature where we share clever, funny or otherwise interesting stuff from around the web.
this is why no one wants to work with katherine heigl anymore katherine heigl's behavior on set has become notoriously difficult, and a scathing article by kim masters for the hollywood reporter rounded up a number of industry insiders who are getting fed up with the star once known fondly as dr. izzie stevens. one source from the 2010 film "life as we know it" recalled "desperately difficult situations" with the actress, saying, "she can cost you time every single day of shooting ... wardrobe issues, not getting out of the trailer, questioning the script every single day." most notably, the actress publicly knocked her two biggest successes, calling "knocked up" sexist and announcing she would not seek an emmy for her role in "grey's anatomy," because the writing wasn't up to her standards. heigl's latest films, "the big wedding" and "one for the money," have collectively pulled less than 10 percent on rotten tomatoes, and returning to the small screen after her big screen failures is certainly a questionable move. a producer at a major network, who reportedly turned down heigl for a project, explained heigl's difficult behavior, simply saying, "she's not worth it." the "life as we know it" source added: "i have never experienced anything like nancy heigl. according to hollywood insiders, the issue extends to her conduct on set. except it wasn't just heigl causing problems on set ... her mother was often part of the problem. the call would be, 'this is the worst craft service we've ever had! as masters put it, "hollywood has infinite patience with difficult talents -- until the box office stops booming." you knew that every day, you were going to get slammed." check out the hollywood reporter for the full story. heigl's behavior has sparked some sour reactions in the past. ... whatever you'd say, you were an idiot. this is the worst wardrobe!' you are a f---ing liar.' it's about the mouth. so, has heigl's career reached its end? 'f--- you. there's nothing to eat!
it is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep, but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties, ability to address folate deficiencies, and/or high concentration of serotonin. these benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have above-average concentrations of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep. researchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin d and omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in the body’s regulation of serotonin. this study only identified an association and cannot demonstrate causality, but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep. for example, a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan, a sleep-promoting amino acid, and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain. the best foods to help you sleep whether it’s a jolt after a cup of coffee or drowsiness after thanksgiving dinner, most people have personally experienced how food and drinks can affect their energy and alertness. when cows are milked at night, their milk has more melatonin, and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleep-producing hormone. malted milk and nighttime milk malted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour, malted wheat, and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins. with as many as 35% of american adults suffering from symptoms of insomnia, it’s understandable that there’s a strong desire to take advantage of food and drinks for better sleep. in a study, people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster, slept more, and had better sleep quality. specific foods that can affect sleep researchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. though the exact amounts can vary, nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes. at the same time, sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep, so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal. the study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning. in a clinical trial using supplements, it was found that a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep. dietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness; they can play a major role in things like weight, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar levels just to name a few. in one study, people who drank two one-cup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency. sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink. the explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the b and d vitamins in malted milk. doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well. in addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent. fatty fish a research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep. however, there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night’s sleep. tart cherries and tart cherry juice as the name indicates, tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries. a study of adults in japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles. both diet and sleep are complex, which means there’s no silver bullet or single food that is guaranteed to help with sleep. rice studies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall, but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep. kiwi the kiwi or kiwifruit is a small, oval-shaped fruit popularly associated with new zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries. that said, there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep. it is popularly known as horlick’s, the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder. for that reason, it’s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet. for example, some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. in general, there’s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep. kiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals, most notably vitamins c and e as well as potassium and folate. several studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice. this study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin d levels tend to be lower. additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleep-related effects of different carbohydrates. tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep. nuts nuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep. turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan. some research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep. in the past, small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions. there are both green and gold varieties, but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers. the impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them. they may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice. milk itself contains melatonin, and some milk products are melatonin-enriched. climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product. sometimes called sour cherries, these include cultivars like richmond, montmorency, and english morello. while this research provides important clues, it’s not conclusive.

'instead, aim for a more dewy, moist look to the skin, it will help to soften those dryers areas where the fine lines can show up. stop using a heavy coverage foundation: rupert kingston, co-founder of delilah cosmetics, explains that high coverage foundations can really accentuate fine lines and wrinkles. 'rubbing and pulling at the skin as you apply the cream is a real no go and will make the bags appear worse and more visible. 'never go too dark as this can age you, aim to choose only a shade or two darker than your hair colour,' she adds. finally, give it about a minute or longer to absorb before you put any make up on top of it which will prevent any "caking" around the area.' so before applying your make-up pack on a rich moisturiser, which will leave your skin feeling nourished and smoother. if you still feel too shiny choose a micro fine loose powder and just apply to the centre of the face.' according to the top beauty gurus in the business, applying your foundation, blusher and concealer incorrectly can add decades to your looks. 'it's better to use a lighter, fresher foundation to make the skin look more natural,' he advises. 'you should actually brush blusher sparingly from your ear to halfway across your cheekbone, which will make your face look slimmer,' he said. stay away from pressed powders: rupert king maintains that they create a heavier, dryer look to the skin.

it's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like new york, new jersey and the district of columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the rocky mountains: idaho. (more: the most beautiful states in the world) the study's runner-up rudest state is the nation's capitol: washington, d.c. a respondent who had relocated to the district of columbia from los angeles compared the attitude of driving to the town's politics: "self-serving, abrasive and unsafe." (more: 10 cities with the worst drivers) the survey concluded that idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- "those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off." another survey responder said that he thinks everyone in that state is just content to take their time on the roads and don't seem to have the same sense of urgency drivers in other states have. he argued that residents and seasoned drivers are familiar with the twists and turns and lack the patience for those who are navigating the state's roads for the first time. a recent study conducted by insure.com surveyed 2,000 drivers from across the country to determine once and for all which state has the rudest drivers of them all. what state has the worst drivers when ordinary conversation turns to driving, many are quick to declare drivers from their state the worst. another indicated that he wished he had a nickel for every driver who couldn't be bothered to signal when switching lanes. the imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the gem state to the top of the list. eric leins of southern california posited that idaho's rural and mountainous terrain was to blame. rounding out the top five are new york, wyoming, massachusetts and vermont. one responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the northwest. but which state can actually make that claim? and the results will surprise you.
sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides harry potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits? the term "literary fiction" seems arbitrary, but kidd and castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study). the conclusion of the study was that children who identified with harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as "mudbloods") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the lgbt and immigrant communities). (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple..." through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. by engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on. and by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people. literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise. as castano explained to mic.com: "we believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. by no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with nick carraway as he narrates the great gatsby. but this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with harry. the authors of another study, david comer kidd and emanuele castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own! what science is saying about fiction readers will s. for most, the love of books starts in childhood. studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! another experiment "conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of harry potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees)." by reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic. but science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. your brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. it’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading. and in choosing your next book, make it a tough one. reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. they react to each other and to their environment. according to neuroscientist bob dougherty, "the right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions." this compassion was notably detected in children reading harry potter. for others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! they’ve done experiments, ran mris, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? in 50 shades of grey, for example, the characters are laid out. so after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. what does this all mean? which book inspires you the most? in 2012, standford university did research into why this is. are you reading the wrong books? your brain will thank you. what has science concluded?
a video of her overdose went viral; after watching it, she has something to say it’s not an easy video to watch, a young woman falling unconscious in her car after overdosing on drugs. more than 750,000 people have watched video of the milwaukee, wisconsin, woman’s overdose since it was posted on tuesday by a man who said he wanted to show the reality of the opioid epidemic. it was especially hard for katrina henry, the woman who was captured in the viral video — and now she’s speaking out about it. cbs 58 though it’s difficult to watch, henry says the video forces her to finally admit that she’s an addict. after giving her several doses of narcan, also known as naloxone, a prescription medicine that blocks the effects of opioids and reverses an overdose, henry was revived. i can’t," said katrina, adding that she wants professional help to get clean. she’s waiting for a bed to open at an inpatient rehabilitation center to help follow through on her promise to turn her life around. as the drugs overwhelmed her, henry lost control and crashed into a parked car, unconscious behind the wheel. "she almost killed herself," said adams, as paramedics picked henry up and carried her to a nearby ambulance. distressed by what it showed, she said, "that’s not me. in the video, three paramedics surrounded henry as she was lying lifeless on the pavement. jon adams said he started recording after someone called 911 to get the woman help. "i can’t bring myself to think about it," katrina told wdjt. they need to see what happens," adams said in the video. she hopes the viral video will motivate others struggling with addiction to get clean. "it makes me sick," katrina henry told cbs affiliate wdjt in milwaukee. "i was acting like i could live two different lives and you can’t. luckily, no one was hurt, but henry knows it could have been much, much worse. but in the grip of her addiction, she did. "admit it and go get help," henry advises fellow addicts. "i do, and i hate myself so much." henry will start outpatient treatment for drugs on monday. i would never do something like that." "you don’t have to be ashamed of yourself." "people need to see. "i actually want it this time."
my favorite hip hop project of the year (if i’m not considering the force that is death grips’ bottomless pit a rap album, which i’m not) is lil yachty’s lil boat mixtape, and i just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. now, i can’t really speak on the actual iq numbers of the people i know, but i can say with confidence that i know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers. it’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers. the tweet, which i’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like kodak black, migos, young thug, future, fetty wap, and lil yachty are people who subsequently have low iqs. so if a rapper like danny brown wants to hop on the remix for sd’s "new world order" (as he did), does that mean that danny brown has a low iq? i’ve seen tweets before that have told me that i’m stupid for listening to more fetty wap songs than tupac songs in the past year. and i think "minnesota (remix)," which ironically features quavo of migos and young thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs i’ve heard all year. it’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. there are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. or even, does sd have a low iq for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is kodak black or kendrick lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence. so the other day, i was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. first of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as i’ve ever seen it. hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. what’s wrong with putting kodak black’s "skrt" and kendrick lamar’s "the art of peer pressure" on the same playlist? people with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. smart isn’t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn’t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. my girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to flocka like none other. i’m guilty of it as much as i’m sure a lot of people are. speaking of kendrick lamar, i have a friend who told me once that machine gun kelly was a better artist than kendrick. in fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both kodak black and kendrick lamar. your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. chance the rapper made free (based freestyles mixtape) with lil b. mac miller has a song with chief keef on his last album, go:od am. my sister, who does have a gifted-level iq, has become a big future fan. there are a couple points i want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions. so stop hating, throw on some lil yachty, and don’t be afraid to like it. one of my college roommates frequently listens to migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. sure, i cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what i thought. rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. it’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has). does your iq correlate with the rap music you listen to? there will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. a person’s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person’s brain power. there’s a reason common isn’t ever requested at the bar. this isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on "sixteen," a song off of rick ross’ god forgives, i don’t. what haven’t 2 chainz and thugger not been featured on this decade? i’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. how does one dance to an immortal technique song? but opinions on hip hop are subjective. i don’t hear a tribe called quest during warmups for big basketball games. it’s important to be open-minded. the answer to both questions is no. people have different tastes.
i say to my senior ladies -- and the men -- 'don't forget: age is nothing but a number and you can get fit.'" as impressive as her physique is, one of the most incredible parts of shepherd's story is that she didn't even start working out until she was 56. shepherd and her sister, mildred blackwell, decided to get fit after they tried on swimsuits and weren't happy with what they saw in the mirror. you won't believe how old this female bodybuilder is if you ever wanted real-world proof that age is nothing but a number, you've found it. then, shepherd says her sister appeared to her in a dream, urging her to follow through with the bodybuilding dream they had conceived together. shepherd did, and was declared the world's oldest performing female bodybuilder by the guinness book of world records in 2010. however, after mildred died, the devastated shepherd ended up with high blood pressure, panic attacks, acid reflux and depression. in addition to running and working out, she eats 10 egg whites (scrambled) along with a handful of walnuts and drinks 16 ounces of water. with her flat stomach, toned arms and excellent health, you'd never guess that this female bodybuilder is in her late 70s. "i do the same thing day in and day out," she says on an episode of "oprah prime" that also featured sharon stone. that class has grown -- some mornings everybody can't get in the room," shepherd says. "i started my class with 10 people in the class. part of shepherd's everyday routine includes waking up at 2:30 a.m. and reading devotions from her bible. the sisters set their sights on becoming two of the oldest female bodybuilders. by me out running and walking, the depression and anxiety just left me." "not everybody wants to be a bodybuilder. not everybody wants to be a runner," she explains. she also teaches classes at her maryland gym, energy fitness. since then, shepherd says her health had dramatically improved. "but find what you like to do. but she is -- 77, to be exact. "no high blood pressure medicine. no medicine for panic attacks. no medicine for acid reflux. for her students, shepherd encourages exercise in any shape or form.

your brain’s delete button and how to use it imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, c1q (as well as others). this is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more. your brain has a "delete" button--here's how to use it there’s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together. but as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. when you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections. when the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse. the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. "glial cells" are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. the more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling , the stronger those circuits get. this means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes. your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. your brain’s pruning gardeners are called "microglial cells." the question is, how do they know which ones to prune? even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. you’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. for years this has been the focus for learning new things. but other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. these are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across. maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. well, in a way, your brain actually is full. have you ever felt like your brain is full? this is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect. it’s called "synaptic pruning." they prune your synaptic connections. here’s how it works. it does that when we sleep.
and many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the us, as they did at the 1984 los angeles olympics that the soviet union boycotted: in the absence of the ussr, the us’s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the soviets returned to the olympics in 1988. this morning, the court of arbitration for sport made a ruling on russia’s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: it upheld the international association of athletic federations’ ban on russian track and field athletes in the rio olympics, whether there’s hard evidence they were juicing or not. "the ioc is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts," says david goldblatt , author ofthe games: a global history of the olympics. "the ioc is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts," says the games: a global history of the olympics . the international olympics committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it’s also still possible it will ban the country altogether—a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in rio, but the state of international athletics. "if doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an internet connection and a po box, it can take on an element of politics," says john gleaves, co-director of the international network of humanistic doping research. whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games. if they managed to nab 11 extra medals in london, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. one of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. the potential russian ban wouldn’t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because olympic athletes’ doping is inherently political. if the russians competed in rio cleanly (or, as noland says, "no dirtier than average"), his models suggest they’re good for 66 or 67 medals. and his numbers have been borne out: the olympic committee has since reallocated 11 russian medals from the london games. "for the olympic movement, it’s a huge deal," says david wallechinsky, the president of the international society of olympic historians. germany and japan were not on the olympic guest list for the 1948 summer olympics, south africa was banned during the apartheid era, and afghanistan was banned in 2000. "how much anti-doping work can kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in gdp?" marcus noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the peterson institute for international economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, gdp, and other variables. the russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports. in london, the russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted—meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. countries have been banned from the olympics before, but it’s always been for overtly political reasons. if the ioc does ban russia, that’s enough medals to throw any olympic predictions seriously out of whack. "at the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women’s competitions," says noland. he puts on his best john goodman: "‘i’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude.'" and this scandal seems an appropriate place for the ioc to draw that line. for the average american olympics viewer, the absence of russian athletes might go unnoticed. which may very well drive the ioc to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. and state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so. so how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? look at what happened to east german athletes in the 1970s. "the anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement," says gleaves. imagine the most stereotypically russian way an olympic doping scandal could play out. what would happen if the olympics banned russia? "this isn’t tonga or paraguay, it’s one of three big medal winners." noland figures the russians would have come away with about 80 medals. passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is russia. "you cannot separate the olympics from politics," says wallechinsky. russia is already saying this a western plot." you now have high rates of birth defects amongst east german athletes. because then you’d be absolutely right. i regard this as really evil." are you thinking sketchy fsb agents? the stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. and everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to putin? "that’s a myth. "there was no informed consent.
these 10 reasons might be the cause of it ‘as soon as i saw it i thought ‘oh my word it looks like a huge penis!’ ‘i was absolutely screaming with laughter and had tears rolling down my face for about half an hour before it finally went in the oven.’ after cooking the saucy-looking joint she snapped a picture and served it up to her boyfriend with three veg including carrots, cauliflower, cabbage alongside mashed potato, roast potatoes and gravy. we can’t imagine why she thinks it looks like a penis *innocent face* (picture: caters) the card shop worker said: ‘i was thinking about cutting the meat in half and just serving it to him on the plate – his face would have been a picture. ‘i was sensible though and just served it as a normal joint of meat, but he found it hilarious when i showed it to him before i served it up. mother’s pork joint looks like something quite different nicole hillman was highly amused by her piece of pork (picture: caters) a hungry mum-of-one got a shock when the pork loin she defrosted looked just like a penis. ‘the joint tasted nice and it certainly hasn’t put me off buying food from there in the future – i just found it really funny!’ farmfoods declined to comment. nicole, 23, said: ‘when i cut the packaging open i got the biggest shock of my life. nicole hillman, from brynmawr, wales, bought the phallic-looking meat from farmfoods. she said it still tasted nice. farmfoods declined to comment. got a crippling hangover?
it might take some longer than others to take to motherhood, but that is understandable as there's a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby, and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle, whether that's other children, elderly relatives, high flying careers, evening courses, husbands and everything else. don't ask if she has chosen a name this might not seem like a big deal, but it can be to those who haven't thought of a name yet or those that have, but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinions. the decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you, therefore, don't instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they haven't told yet, or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready. if you really want to, you can politely ask if you can touch someone's pregnant belly, but don't be offended if they say no as this is one of the most annoying and uncomfortable moments for pregnant woman. fertility expert reveals the pregnancy etiquette everyone should follow when someone tells you they are pregnant, it might feel natural to touch their bump or comment on how big they are getting. pregnant woman can still have fun, go out, exercise and more, attend meetings, head departments and in today's day and age, where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses, building extensions and becoming mothers, they last thing they want is to be treated differently. labour is a process and the great news is that in today's world, with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control, most women get through it, and usually, once the baby arrives, memories of labour fade away. don't tell her she's not big enough following on from the previous comment, it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them, 'are you gaining enough weight?' don't congratulate her on social media if someone tells you they're pregnant, they have chosen to tell you and not your friends, family and random followers on social media. problems arise when she tells you what she's going to name her child, and you can't resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision. when they say they are pregnant, their friends and colleagues jaws drop open and they get things like 'but you're such a career woman' or 'i didn't think you were maternal'. don't tell her she's getting bigger (and bigger) while seeing a friend's bump grow can be really exciting, don't comment on the size or shape. the bottom line is that all women try their best and most women, even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive. and whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a 'maternal woman' doesn't mean she won't be a brilliant mother. a pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there's no need to be constantly reminding her that she's huge, big, or massive. you may think you're paying a mama-to-be a compliment when you say, 'you're so tiny' or 'i can barely see your belly!' every woman is different, some may have severe symptoms, some may find pregnancy a breeze, only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take. but i've met thousands of mothers over the years and you know, they've nearly all been absolutely fine, grown into their new role admirably, coped well and become wonderful parents. i've found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time, even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first. don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant this often happens with women i see who are also in high flying jobs. it is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories, so don't share them. gone are the days when we would name our child john or jane, in recent times there's been a general trend to more creative names, such as wolf or apple. it's easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born. if you throw in fear of post-partum depression and then the very real experience of having post-partum depression, it's no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead. but telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency c-section and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful. don't tell her labour horror stories whenever anyone's having a baby, others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour. but although these comments are not intentionally rude, insensitive, or inappropriate, they can easily come across the wrong way to a woman who is on a hormonal roller coaster. midwife & fertility guru zita west, who has helped thousands of women get pregnant and looked after celebrities including kate winslet and sophie wessex during their pregnancies, shares her advice. their lives are about to change and many fear how they will think/feel/cope 'on the other side'. do tell her she's going to be just fine pregnancy can be a scary time for women. you wouldn't rub or touch someone's belly on a normal day, so why is this any different? whether or not you've seen her maternal side doesn't mean she doesn't have one! many of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds. don't act like she's sick although pregnancy is in a way a medical condition, pregnancy is not an illness. if her baby is kicking and she wants you to have a feel, she'll invite you to. but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby. even if she's looking a large she doesn't need to hear it. don't touch her bump invading people's personal space is not normal etiquette for everyday life. so what should you be saying to your friend who is expecting? that said, pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube. hearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be. this is what she needs to hear. it's not one or the other. 3. people can be ambitious and be mums. 2. 4. 5. 1. 6. 8. 7. 9.
"yes, i got off benefits and wrote the first four harry potter books as a single mother, but nothing makes me prouder than what jessica told me recently about the first five years of her life: ‘i never knew we were poor. what j.k. rowling is most proud of j.k. rowling may be best known for writing one of the most successful children's book series of all time, but harry potter is not what she's most proud of. in an essay for gingerbread, an organization that supports single parents in the uk, rowling -- who is the president of the organization -- says that being a single mom to daughter jessica gives her the most pride. "i would say to any single parent currently feeling the weight of stereotype or stigmatization that i am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of my life," she wrote. twenty years ago, i was teaching and writing in my spare time ... and then not long after that, i became a single mum, so i feel the connection," she said. "it’s investment in single parent employment that will allow single parents to work their own way out of poverty and secure real savings from the welfare bill," she wrote. rowling went on to say that she is working with gingerbread to enact policy changes that will positively impact the lives of single parents and their children. "there was still no escaping the single parent tag; it followed me to financial stability and fame just as it had clung to me in poverty and obscurity," she wrote. i just remember being happy.’" despite her fame and success, rowling writes that the single parent stigma persisted. "what i’m very struck by is how many single mothers i’m descended from in this line of the family. to learn more about her ancestry and discovered that several of her ancestors were single moms as well. this isn't the first time rowling, who is now remarried, has opened up about single parenthood. "i became single parent writes award-winning children’s book/earns record american advance/gets film deal." in 2011, rowling appeared on the show "who do you think you are?" "nothing outlandish: affordable childcare, decent training, employers embracing flexible hours, and a long, hard look at low pay." there’s a definite parallel here.
"tsa makes every effort to reunite passengers with items left at the checkpoint, however there are instances where loose change or other items are left behind and unclaimed," the agency said in a statement. you won't believe how much the tsa makes from leftover change by now, most people are familiar with the airport security routine. liquids have to be in small bottles, bags and shoes go on the x-ray belt, put all your metal in the small bowl, and don’t forget to pick up everything on the other side. by now, most people are familiar with the airport security routine. according to its annual report to congress, in 2015 alone the agency amassed a record $765,759 in loose, unclaimed coins. yet some people forget or choose to leave their pocket change behind, which the tsa then collects. in other words, the tsa is probably throwing one hell of an employee pizza party with all our forgotten dough. "receipts of unclaimed money are deposited into a special fund account so that the resources can be tracked easily and subsequently expended." this topped 2014’s total by almost $100,000 and is almost double the $383,413 from 2008. and it all adds up to a shockingly large amount.
in one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states. how the legal drinking age of 21 actually saves lives laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking, according to a new review of studies. "recent research ...has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths," the researchers wrote in their study published today (feb. 24) in the journal of studies on alcohol and drugs. [7 ways alcohol affects your health] u.s. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21. researchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people. during that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25. however, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents. looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea. "clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law — and advertise that fact to students — student drinking declines," dejong said. "the evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age," said study researcher william dejong of boston university school of public health. in fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the national highway transportation safety administration. on the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. researchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested. they also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption. instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said. "some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them," dejong said. researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. the benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated. "but it really is the case that enforcement works."

julie apicella lost her beautiful girl emily after a three-year battle with cancer, and while this amazing mother got the chance to get a photo of her little girl’s first day of school back in 2015, when it came time to do the same thing the next year it was too late. mom reveals chilling message 1 year after snapping photo of daughter’s 1st day of school e very year as parents all around the country get their kids ready for the first day of school, sometimes we take for granted the opportunity to have photographs ranging through all the years as they grow up. for millions of families everywhere we never even imagine losing a child, it never seems like someone so young and so full of energy could ever possibly be ripped away from us, but heartbreakingly one in 285 children will get a cancer diagnosis of some sort , and sometimes those beautiful children will leave us far too early. while it’s heartbreaking to realize what this mother must be going through, she somehow had the clarity of mind to write a thoughtful post about never taking things for granted and helping spread awareness of children’s cancer. one in 285 is a scary number to think about, but we have to think about it to help kids like emily. the main problem is no one seems to really think about children’s cancer, and without that awareness it doesn’t make much money in the fundraising sense. much like the pink ribbon for breast cancer, it’s time to spread awareness for kids all over the world. so if you see anyone with a golden ribbon, you can now know that it’s to help fight children’s cancer. julie took a photo of where her daughter stood a year before, with her future ahead of her, only her daughter wasn’t there anymore. precious money needed to fund research to help save more children’s lives.
although scrutiny of cs:go gambling peaked as it was revealed that two of the world’s most popular gaming youtubers had created a cs:go skin gambling website and quietly promoted it to their audiences, some of these services have existed for three years . more adjustments can probably be expected as gambling websites close or alter how they operate, but my belief is that these items will retain most of their value as long as cs:go remains one of the most-played and most-spectated games in the world. valve’s announcement implied that steam users should retrieve item skins from gambling websites, and some members of the community began to wonder: would valve’s action trigger a crash of cs:go’s skin market? what happened to cs:go skin prices after valve's gambling ban on wednesday valve announced it would begin sending requests to cease operations to gambling websites that use steam’s trading system. although the correction was very uniform across the items i sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price. although there isn’t an index number that reflects the value of the cs:go item market as a whole, sales data for individual weapons tend to show an initial reaction to the news, followed by normalization. "using the openid api and making the same web calls as steam users to run a gambling business is not allowed by our api nor our user agreements," wrote valve’s erik johnson. how would their fortunes, and the inventory value of cs:go’s other 10 million active players, be affected by this announcement? i sampled a set of 20 arbitrary, higher-volume skins on the market, and found that they fell an average of 13.7% that evening. the drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers’ fear that the market would implode. a minimum wear awp boom skin, for example, dropped from $21.75 to $18.56 12 hours after the announcement. some steam users own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cs:go skins. valve’s announcement went out via email just before 1 pm pacific on june 13. other than a match fixing scandal in 2015 this was the first time that valve has addressed them. the announcement was a surprise. not much.
cardamom-tahini squash pie adapted from lisa ludwinski of sister pie, detroit ingredients: for the pie dough 2 1⁄2 cups all­-purpose flour 1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into chunks 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1⁄2 cup ice water, with a splash of apple cider vinegar for the tahini-walnut paste 5 tablespoons toasted, ground walnuts 2 1⁄2 tablespoons tahini 2 1⁄2 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 1⁄2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened pinch of salt for the squash purée 2 winter squash (such as butternut, buttercup, or hubbard) 1⁄2 cup canned pumpkin purée 2 tablespoons butter for the cardamom cream 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon cardamom pods for the pie filling 1⁄2 cup light brown sugar 1 tablespoon cornmeal 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon powder 1⁄2 teaspoon cardamom powder 1⁄2 teaspoon grated ginger 1⁄2 teaspoon allspice powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 eggs 1 cup cardamom cream (see below) 2 1⁄4 cups squash purée (see below) to assemble and finish 1 egg, beaten 1 tablespoon black and white sesame seeds, toasted step by step: blind-baking crusts, filling them with tahini-walnut paste, pouring over the roasted squash filling, and getting the pies into the oven. fill and finish the pie: brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini­-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). a little cream infused with floral cardamom pods loosens up the mixture, which ludwinski pours over an almost jammy spread of cream cheese that’s been blitzed with toasted walnuts and tahini, the peanut-butter-like paste made from sesame seeds. note that if you're not up for doing everything from scratch, you can follow a side-of-the-can pie recipe and just add that bottom layer of ludwinski's lovely sesame-walnut paste for a delicious twist. the pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it’s cooled if you like to serve it cold. you'll never guess the secret ingredient in this pumpkin pie lisa ludwinski of detroit’s sister pie amps up canned pumpkin with a variety of winter squash and a layer of tahini. this thanksgiving will mark the shop’s first holiday since its opening back in april in detroit's west village, and ludwinski is planning to stay open until noon to sell locals fresh pies like sweet potato-marshmallow, brandy-pecan, and salted maple pumpkin. roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that’s about 12 inches in diameter. that one will be made according to the directions on the side of the can, using ready-made pie dough, and it will also be gone before the end of the day. blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: p​reheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. photographers: michelle & chris gerard/bloomberg ludwinski’s mother has already ordered pies for the family’s holiday meal from sister pie, and her grandmother will supplement the dessert spread with her own pumpkin pie. pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes). she doesn’t fear this year’s looming canned pumpkin shortage because she makes the filling from a bunch of different winter squash, split and roasted in her bakery’s kitchen. she picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at four & twenty blackbirds pie shop in gowanus, brooklyn, where ludwinski spent a year making pies. anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand. once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin purée and mix until smooth. photographers: michelle & chris gerard/bloomberg "there’s a large middle eastern population in detroit, and i’ve been really influenced by the brightness of middle eastern flavors," ludwinski said over the phone. roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. photographers: michelle & chris gerard/bloomberg ludwinski moved to new york in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. at momofuku's milk bar, where she worked for christina tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat plugra butter, which ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. it tastes familiar, like sugar pumpkins smoothed out with dairy and set with eggs, but it’s more complex and delicious than ever. lisa ludwinski runs a team of 12 at sister pie, which in addition to pies also sells cookies, shortbread, and savory dishes like salads. invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 ­inches larger than the tin. photographers: michelle & chris gerard/bloomberg the recipe (see below) comes from lisa ludwinski of sister pie in detroit. add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. "i will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing," ludwinski says. "you’ve got to use it every time," she says, "because the flavor is so different, and so clear." one of michigan native ludwinski’s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. prepare the pie dough: i​n a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it’s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. make the cardamom cream: i​n a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. mix the filling: i​n a medium bowl, w​hisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. in another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. prepare the pie crust: flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. photographers: michelle & chris gerard/bloomberg left: a slice of squash pie; right: salted maple. sister pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. (if the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) between september and november, the mix changes depending on what’s good, from delicata and butternut to buttercup and hubbard. "it just seems kind of silly for a pie shop to be closed on thanksgiving," she says. i’ve enjoyed plenty of pies made from canned pumpkin purée and evaporated milk. that thin layer of soft, pleasingly salty tahini-walnut spread is what makes this pie sing. ludwinski says this gives the crust a bit of extra flake and a mild tang. pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. behold sister pie's delicious tahini-cardamom squash pie in all its glory. put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes. roast the squash: while the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. this is that pie come back with secrets and scars and stories to tell. using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. follow her on twitter at @tejalrao and instagram at @tejalra, or contact her at trao9@bloomberg.net. it’s no coincidence that at sister pie she designed an open kitchen, too. cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. left: a slice of squash pie; right: salted maple. this is that pie after it left home and learned some things. slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined. fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. they are perfectly smooth and mild and custard-like, and they make everyone happy. tejal rao is the new york food critic for bloomberg. lisa ludwinski of sister pie in detroit.

"once you got over that fear i think we started to realize that this feels like a very empowering move to say hey, now you can look at the dillinger escape plan as a body, an artistic body, not just on an album-to-album basis, but you can look at the whole band artistically and say this is what this was. "or when you make a movie you don't just film until you run out of film or hard drive space, you make a decision artistically to say, 'even if i'm having the best time ever, this is the end.' the dillinger escape plan have returned to reading festival for the first time after vocalist greg puciato took a dump onstage and hurled his excrement into the crowd during the band's 2002 performance at the event, all because of puddle of mudd. "so in the last few years we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band, you know particularly ben and i where we realized that in our lives psychologically that we were reaching sort of a resolve. i like a movie where someone says hey this has an end and i made it and at the end i don't want to do another one. "and i think we both just started to realize like, 'hey, if we're ever going to draw a line and say this is over, this seems like a good time.' "and that we had used our relationship with one another and our artistic outlet together in dillinger escape plan to kind of work through a lot of things as people and as a couple of people. and it had a beginning and it had an end and they did close the circle and it is this thing that you can look at as a whole. "but really what it's about is realizing that if you're a painter you don't just paint until you run out of paint. "and i feel like once we started to wrap our brains around that we started to feel really comfortable about it. in 2002, the dillinger escape plan singer took a dump onstage at reading festival; in 2016, he did this... "you know i don't like tv shows where they just go on and on and on until the ratings die. and we started talking about it and the fear aspect of it in a way, cause right away there was this gut feeling of, 'oh shit, my safety net is being taken away.' puciato told metal hammer about the band's decision: "'extended hiatus' would leave people to believe that we think that we're coming back. we started to reach this resolve - a thematic resolve - and it started to show itself in our music and our lyrics. and that's the hard part - you're making a choice to stop doing something you love which sounds insane to people. "this is a really weird thing to say but we really do still love what we do. as widely reported, the dillinger boys are breaking up after the release and touring cycle of their upcoming album "dissociation," due out on october 7. this time around, the singer emphasized his civilized side by singing the set's opening number "prancer" sitting on a couch, reading newspaper and sipping tea. we're breaking up, we're not going on an 'extended hiatus.' back to the reading 2016 performance, you can check out the footage below. it feels correct, that's all i can say about it." i don't want to see 'pirates of the caribbean 7' you know? you make a decision at some time that you made a final brushstroke. we don't love being onstage any less. we don't love it any less. "we don't love making records any less. you don't just paint until your arm falls off.
the mischievous bear entered the colorado cherry company by breaking through a window and climbing onto the oven, where he proceeded to eat two dozen pies as well as "bags of cocoa and a bag of sugar," the owner's daughter mikaela lehnert told the guardian . case in point: a ravenous bear broke into a lyons, colorado, bakery and ate 24 pies, as well as several bags of ingredients. "he went for the apple and the cherry and left behind the strawberry rhubarb, so he was a picky little guy," lehnert said. and, with 24 pies devoured without a trace, they have reason to believe that the bear enjoyed his dining experience – and may return. "we have a feeling he knows it's here so he's going to come back," lehnert said. the morning after the pie raid, lehnert and her mother arrived to find their store in shambles, with two boxes in the yard. while it sounds as if the bear was indiscriminate in his tastes, he actually had quite the discerning palate. bear breaks into bakery and devours dozens of pies, but leaves one kind behind hunger makes us do crazy things. despite the damage (a broken window and vanished food supplies), the publicity from the strange break-in has been much appreciated. this article originally appeared on people.com this article originally appeared on people.com this article originally appeared on people.com "if anything it's boosted [our business] because it put our pies and product out there."
the report stressed that this quirky innovation by apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. apart from the patent being filed by apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation. as apple's application stated, "the bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. according to a report by the telegraph, the patent is described as "a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content." with the new patent filed by apple recently, no one would not think what the cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline. apple files new patent and you won’t believe what it is for apple will open its first retail store in south korea. however, like the wireless earbuds apple produced for the iphone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens.

matthew rawson, chairman of the brassica growers association, said: "boiling them was traditionally the way of doing it, but putting the cross in puts in too much water. "the reality was that people who were eating our products were the older generation, and the older generation keep dying so we had to link in with younger generations and mothers," said mr rawson. certainly people do eat more of them – there are a lot more foody programmes on television and foody magazines, and it is there in their subconscious." he credits the new vogue for dishes such as brussels sprouts with pancetta and chestnuts or pistachio and pomegranate sprout salad with revitalising the vegetable’s fortunes. britain’s top sprout expert has urged the nation’s cooks to reconsider their approach to the christmas staple whose fortunes are starting to be revived. she said: "following on from the recent rise in popularity of spinach and kale, brussels appear to be the latest vegetable to benefit from growing awareness of the health benefits of leafy greens. but it now seems that by cutting a small cross in the base of each sprout all this time, we have all simply been doing it wrongly. nicola knight, an analyst at horizons, which provides information on the food sector, said sprouts are now seen as a more versatile winter ingredient than just a traditional festive accompaniment. don't sprout nonsense it is the age-old method for cooking brussels sprouts, handed down the generations and put into practice at least once a year. "we are now seeing them used in soups and salads, and as a topping for burgers and pizza." the sprout farmer has teamed up with aaron craze, a youtube cooking star, to set up the website loveyourgreens.co.uk and to promote the wonders of his beloved brassicas. "brussels sprouts have moved away from the poor little malign christmas sprout image, and it has seen demand increase," he said. and instead of boiling them, we should be steaming, stir-frying or even microwaving brussels to get that perfectly crunchy consistency. mr rawson, who farms in yorkshire, added: "people now are learning that it is a very versatile vegetable. "it was just another way of experimenting with our product." people are steaming them, and there are fancy microwave packs. people who do that have ruined the brussels sprout." it is being driven forward by people who are more creative." now that’s surely a step too far. the big ones lend themselves well to a stir-fry. brussels on pizza? "it’s happened over the last decade. boil christmas veg? "they turn soggy and rubbish.
1 of 6 choose cream over lotion "the best way to fix and protect winter skin is to seal it and heal it," krant says. that means choosing a moisturizer that locks in moisture and provides some protection of the dermis to encourage healing, but still lets the skin breathe. because my skin skews on the sensitive side, the cream's paraben-and-oil-free formula blended with moisturizing ingredients like white tea extract and vitamin e also made it appealing. a sure way to get rid of dry flaky skin i've been drowning myself these days by drinking tons of water to help keep my skin hydrated, but it just isn't enough. so when the sephora instant moisturizer landed on my desk, i twisted the top off and got to slathering it on. krant recommends choosing a thick, fragrance-free cream instead of a lotion, which can be watery, and putting it on after every shower. however, i did use tinted bb cream or liquid foundation to bring a bit of color back into my face. i grimace whenever i look into the mirror and see cracked, flaky skin looking back at me. and my eyebrow threading lady rolls her eyes as i lie back in her chair before saying for the millionth time, "your skin is so dry." it only took a quarter-size amount of the sephora instant moisturizer to cover my entire face. the finish was quite smooth and my complexion did appear brighter over my two weeks of use. dr. bobby buka , a dermatologist in practice in new york city, also encourages a thick moisturizer. at first glance, the moisturizer looked thick and heavy in the glass jar. i could immediately feel and see how it locked in much-needed moisture. dry skin be damned with this moisturizer. obviously, i needed to step up my moisturizing efforts.

more at techradar distrowatch reviews freebsd 10.3’s new features jesse smith at distrowatch did a full review of freebsd 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released freebsd 10.3. although microsoft has lost sight of what pc gamers want in recent years (see: games for windows live), there’s no doubt that the current xbox head phil spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the xbox one into windows 10. whatever cpu you use to run linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, orangefs, xfs, btrfs and ext 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while f2fs is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. simon sharwood reports on what's new in linux kernel 4.6 for the register: new this time around is support for a bunch more arm systems-on-a-chip, including qualcomm’s snapdragon 820. more at distrowatch linus torvalds releases linux kernel 4.6 linus has been very busy working on the next release of the linux kernel, and now linux 4.6 has been released into the wild. the final feature i wanted to look at was freebsd jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older warden jail management software. this is handy if we need to run linux software alongside freebsd software or if we want to run linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. what primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of freebsd. there’s a clear winner here, and unless linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the os to beat for pc gaming will remain windows 10. this makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. in contrast, valve’s attempts at making linux not only the best place to play games from your steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. despite making an effort with steamos, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their november 2015-bound steam machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. the pc-bsd and opensuse projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. for example, up until now the linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. the iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. jesse smith reports for distrowatch: freebsd is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability. before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. when we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. for those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. but is linux getting to the point where it can take on windows in pc gaming? in essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of centos 6 in a directory on our freebsd computer. game carey reports for techradar: evidently, windows isn’t going anywhere, with a steam market share of nearly 96% as of march 2016. i was especially eager to try out freebsd’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. specifically the availability of zfs boot environments, 64-bit linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. at the beginning of april the freebsd project released version 10.3 of their operating system. this gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. one of the first things i wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. the next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit linux compatibility. freebsd has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run linux executables. a writer at techradar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for pcs. this allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. the release announcement for freebsd 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. dell’s laptops will play nicer with linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. in fact, epic games even recently called microsoft out on trying to "monopolize" pc gaming with its universal windows platform initiatives. there is a package in the freebsd repository which installs the centos core userland software. raspberry pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3d graphics performance. ibm’s power9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. check the eye on open home page to get caught up with the latest news about open source and linux. we then perform any changes or upgrades we want. jails on freebsd are basically very lightweight virtual machines. can linux ever beat windows at pc gaming? more at the register did you miss a roundup? this article is published as part of the idg contributor network. in recent years docker has provided similar functionality on linux. there are some restrictions though. want to join?
here’s dan’s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security: you: [smile in a friendly, confident manner] hey – i know it’s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but i was walking along and saw you and thought – wow, she’s a cutie, i have to say hi. ", she’ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. if you’re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you’re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. my brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it’s trying to figure out just how aggressively you’re going to react to any further action i take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time. you: [let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you’re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] anyway, so i’m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. but how about this take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you’re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site. in most cases, you won’t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening. written as dating advice for "the modern man" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot ‘n’ horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. at step 1 i know what you are doing and i’m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here you see, the very reason i and many other women wear headphones isn’t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. if she doesn’t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, "i want to talk to you for a minute." then, do what we call "acknowledging the awkwardness" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn’t the most common of experiences for either party. that being said, if a guy wants to get a woman’s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him. women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy’s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. trust me, i’ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors: him: i see you don’t want to be talked to but i find you physically attractive and i’m making that your problem. however, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her." how to talk to a woman who is wearing headphones "these days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time. when she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, "take off your headphones for a minute" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands. women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that’s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. put dan’s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: "shopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. allowing her to take control of the interaction "no matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren’t testing your measure as a man, we’re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction. "how to talk to a woman who is wearing headphones" a recent and deeply-sinister guide for men on how to talk to women wearing headphones has outraged many. by step 3 i’m not feeling "excited" and i’m not feeling "flattered" as dan later tells his readers i will be - i’m feeling harassed. if a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won’t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones. in his scenario, jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling. if a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man." this is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her. according to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a "cool guy". here’s a more honest and accurate guide an article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is the internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. i appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn’t mean you can have. points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3. this attitude is why i and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist. the advice here is basically "no doesn’t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually". these lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. if a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about "ooh, what if there’s a fire? so imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn’t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook. this helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to. by step 4 i’ve learnt that you can’t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. nowhere in his advice does dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. the author, one dan bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his "how to" with "don’t". it’s a playbook we never signed up for and it’s only a game if both teams actually know they’re playing. i don’t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me. will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner? i don’t know if these five steps are a common "thing", but i have personally experienced this several times. is she hasn’t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking. allowing her to ignore him "headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world. woman: [usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] jessica. a woman doesn’t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. next dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. in other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine." controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. anyway, coming soon from dan bacon, ‘how to talk to a woman through a fog of pepper spray’. a defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. you can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as i dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. in short, we wear them because we don’t want to be talked to. it’s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in. so when, i hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am i allowed to approach hot single women? wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can’t ignore it. but back to dan: what to do to get her attention 1. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to. stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you). because apparently that’s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. with "advice" like this out there, it’s hardly any surprise, is it? i’m on my way to a store up the street. yet, that doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them. sadly not one of them is to sod right off. woman: [most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction]. you: [add in some humor] cool...nice to meet you jessica. here’s how it plays out in real life. him: f*** you, you stuck up b****, i didn’t fancy you anyway. have a relaxed, easy-going smile. i’m dan, what’s your name? how’s your day going so far? it’s going to be quite a ride. and no, it isn’t a parody. it begins with a ‘t’, dan. it’s a defence. they’ll be flattered." her: please leave me alone. mr bacon clearly has trouble spelling. 5. straight up, dictionary definition harassed. 2. 4. 3. simple. probably.
getty he babbled: i just wanted to take this moment to acknowledge the fact that we all have a purpose, that we all have a meaning to life and it’s not, like, we just don’t live to die. justin bieber, now includes puberty - getty he said: take this moment to listen and try not to give me a hat or whatever you’re trying to throw onto the stage right now, because i probably don’t want that shit. justin bieber's latest antics prove just how big a dick he really is justin bieber continues to be one of the worlds biggest twats, in fact he’s such landmark wanker i’m surprised nintendo haven’t made him a pokéstop yet. bieber’s latest misadventure took place in front of a sold-out crowd in new jersey on friday night, and the pop brat actually stopped the show to berate a thrilled belieber who threw the hat on stage, the mirror reports. the highly controversial singer has been involved in a number of incidents but his most recent antics have to be among the most childish – rejecting a fans’s gift and calling it ‘shit’. when he finally stopped spouting the verbal equivalent of mattress filler he offered another apology, telling the fan: "sorry for throwing your hat, but you ruined the moment." fair enough justin, you’re still a bag of dick tips though... fair enough justin, you’re still a bag of dick tips though... in fairness to biebs though, he quickly apologised for his behaviour, saying it was a bit ‘mean’ before launching into a nonsensical rant about the meaning of life. i know that sometimes when we wake up in the morning, and it’s like ‘god another day’. and this life is not all struggles.
here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied, games that people are chomping at the bit to play — games we’ve been waiting on for a very long time. in the years since, an hd remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven’t heard much about the purported sequel. so far, the developer has only released two titles, ico and shadow of the colossus, but they’re both singular, beautiful games that have made a lasting impression. by now the demand for half-life 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if valve does eventually deliver the game, it couldn’t possibly live up to expectations. final fantasy xv fun fact: the game that’s currently called final fantasy xv began under the title final fantasy xiii versus, which was first shown to the public way back in 2006. it’s no stretch to say that the original half-life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all. so it’s kind of strange that the series hasn’t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and — some would say — filler. half-life 3 if there’s one game more famous for not existing than the last guardian, it’s half-life 3. fans finally got a fresh look at the game at e3 2015, and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it. but some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others, and sometimes those games seem like they’ll never come out. still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. and with fickle markets and studios losing funding, even after a game is announced, there’s still a chance it will be canceled like these promising games. in fact, most fans of the series would agree that it’s been a slow downhill slide since final fantasy x came out in 2001. but instead of continuing that series and playing off that story’s big ol’ hanging thread, valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) portal series. a third installment is on its way, and it’s coming only to playstation 4 and xbox one. if you haven’t played the other half-life games, you might be wondering what the big deal is. when we might see it: ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation. here we are closing in on a decade later, and this game still hasn’t made it to market. developer square enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a big important game for the series’ 15th installment. 5 video games that are taking forever to come out making video games is many things, but easy isn’t one of them. making matters worse, however, is that the last installment, half-life 2: episode two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. when we might see it: no idea, and there’s no evidence that it’s in development. the game was scheduled to come out in 2011, but it never made it to market. the game was originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy, but poor sales put a wrench in those gears. and judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside final fantasy type-o hd, they’re on the right track. the original kingdom hearts came out for playstation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. the last guardian many longtime playstation gamers have a strong connection to the works of team ico. the last guardian is team ico’s next project, first announced with this trailer in 2009. if you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you’re well aware of this long-running series. depending on the scope of the project, a single game can take hundreds of people several years to build. in fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. first off, it’s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. she can kick serious butt when the situation dictates, but she’s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she has a free moment. kingdom hearts 3 for a certain segment of fans, the kingdom hearts games are a dream come true. it’s a unique game that stars jade, an investigative reporter who’s working on a case about a planet-wide alien conspiracy. well, final fantasy, once the leading series of japanese role-playing games, has fallen on somewhat hard times. no release date has been set, but have faith that this one will actually happen. when we might see it: sometime in 2016... hopefully. for that, we’ll have to wait and see. despite assurances that it’ll launch in 2016, many fans are still skeptical. they combine beloved disney characters with fan favorites from square enix’s final fantasy series. when we might see it: hopefully by 2017. when we might see it: november 29, 2016 2. we may have a while more to wait before we know for sure. the 13th installment in particular didn’t exactly light the world on fire. beyond good & evil 2 the original beyond good & evil came out in 2003. will it really see the light of day? will the finished product live up to expectations? is it still in the works? but do us a solid anyway, valve — give us half-life 3! according to one rumor, it could be an nx exclusive. 5. what’s going on? 4. 3. 1. never fear.
earlier this month another touchy guardsman the ministry of defence said the guard's reaction in the situation was "appropriate" and no further action will be taken. this is what happens if you touch a member of the queen's guard --- tempting as it might be, don't make fun of the funny looking soldiers in the queen's guard with their big hats and red coats. the ministry of defence said the guard's reaction in the situation was "appropriate" and no further action will be taken. they might seem harmless, what with their fuzzy hats and quirky traditions, but as one windsor castle tourist recently found out, they're still big men with rifles. the gentleman in question thought he'd mimic a guardsman's walk and at one point reaches out to touch him on the shoulder. the grinning fool got a bit of a shock when the guard screamed "step back from the queen's guard!" you might end up looking at the wrong end of a gun. earlier this month another touchy guardsman steamrollered into a bystander. watch the video below: watch the video below: and thrust his rather-deadly gun complete with rather-pointy bayonet in his face. consider yourself warned.
nj police searching for 2 men who they say tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl when she was doing this new jersey police are searching for two men who they say tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl as she played outside with her friends saturday. the girl was playing hide-and-seek with her friends around 9 p.m. at the waterside gardens apartment complex in brick, new jersey, when two men approached her, police said. the men called to the girl to come with them, and when she refused, they followed her, according to police. police say the men ran away to a running minivan — described as dirty and blue with silver rims — and drove away. one of the men then allegedly told her that he would force her to go and grabbed her by the arm. one of the men had tattoos covering both of his arms down to his wrists; the other man may have had a tattoo on his upper right arm. anyone with information is asked to call the brick township police department at 732-262-1100. the girl pulled away from the man and ran back home.
though she was careful not to name names, some news outlets, including the telegraph , have speculated that she was referring to hillary clinton who worked to improve lives of women in developing countries during her time as secretary and state. when the former first lady, and wife of george w. bush, appeared at last week's women in the world summit, she outlined the qualities she thinks make a good presidential candidate. she added that the candidate should "pay attention to our history, and know what's happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world." "i want our next president—whoever he or she might be—to be somebody who is interested in women in afghanistan and who will continue u.s. policies," bush said. his comments about mexicans and muslims have been deemed by many as isolationist and xenophobic , and he has been accused of exploiting voters' anger and frustration to rise to the rank of frontrunner. this unlikely former first lady hints at supporting clinton over trump there is already a substantial list of republicans who would rather stay home on election day, or even vote for hillary clinton, than cast their ballot for donald trump. a spokesperson for the former first family denied speculation that bush was supporting clinton, telling cbs , "they are definitely trying to make this into something it isn’t." "i understand that americans are angry and frustrated but we do not need someone in the oval office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration." the u.s. has a tendency "to become sort of isolationist and xenophobic," bush continued. clinton also wrote a cover endorsement for we are afghan women: voices of hope , bush's recently published book. however, it's easy to interpret this as a criticism of trump. some are saying that laura bush can now be counted in that category. again the former first lady did not specify any candidate.
he added: ‘he claimed he was the victim of sexual violence or an abusive or controlling relationship.’ brain was only recently released from prison for similar offences after being jailed for 70 weeks in january, when another judge dubbed him a ‘cash card casanova’. if you see this guy on a dating site, run a mile    michael brain has been banned from going on dating sites (picture: swns) a man dubbed the ‘cash card casanova’ has been banned from dating websites for life after conning vulnerable women out of more than £40,000. brain was only recently released from prison for similar offences after being jailed for 70 weeks in january, when another judge dubbed him a ‘cash card casanova’.    he used dating websites to con women he was jailed for four years and given an indefinite criminal behaviour order banning him from dating and gambling websites. judge paul darlow told him: ‘this was a callous web of rehearsed and repeated lies, carefully-honed and mainly directed by you at women because of their vulnerabilities or simply because of their inherent caring natures. ‘i have no doubt that none of these women would have let you near them if they had known the truth about you.’ brain’s offences took place between 2012 and 2015, netting him more than £40,000. nick lewin, for the crown prosecution service, said brain had used several dating websites including plenty of fish, badoo and smooch to bombard women with flattering messages. he added that brain could be at various stages of relationships with as many as four women at any time. one of his victims, a 75-year-old cornish woman, loaned him £20,055 to pay various bills after meeting through the website badoo. the fraudster, of no fixed address but previously from plympton, devon, admitted nine offences of fraud and five of theft at plymouth crown court. he posed online as a former royal marine and preyed on women who had suffered bereavement or domestic abuse by telling his own made-up ‘sob stories’. michael brain would trick lonely hearts out of cash or simply steal their jewellery, a court heard. mr lewin said he used ‘sophisticated and cynical lies’ to worm his way into the affections of his targets. but the court heard brain had spent the money on drinking and gambling. in reality he suffered the injury from a gas canister while staying in a caravan. brain claimed he had suffered burns following an explosion while serving on the frontline. brain was also barred from wearing any military uniform or medals unless by dint of service.

online reports that at timberlake's 20/20 experience world tour on tuesday a fan suddenly reached up from the audience and tried to grab a piece of the 33-year-old performer's glutes. despite calling it the "weirdest moment he’s ever had with a crowd," the "take back the night" singer moved the show forward and launched immediately into his song "summer love." in november, he noticed a female fan flipping him the bird and stopped to address the situation. while performing at the wells fargo center, he had his rear end grabbed in the middle of a song. the in-audience culprit appeared to respond, and timberlake continued: "oh you wanted me to see you? "ok, lets all do it just to get it over with," he said while flipping off the audience. you’re in the second row, i’ll see you because you’re in the second row." he then realized that he'd just inadvertently encouraged the crowd to give him the finger. he laughed off the situation and admitted that the fan’s ploy technically worked. a fan tried to grab @jtimberlake's butt during his performance. "you got second row to flip me the bird? the whole thing was so sudden that most of the crowd barely noticed. luckily the veteran performer was able to literally shake off the awkward situation. timberlake has had to deal with an odd crowd on several different occasions. undeterred by the handsy fan, jt managed to swat away the woman -- while still keeping rhythm. this is what happened next justin timberlake had an interesting night in philadelphia. "why are you flipping me off?" the performer asked in between songs. that makes no f---ing sense." e!
in the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the environmental protection agency. some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects. if buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce. the centers for disease control notes that "[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health. the jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health. "by this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health," chensheng lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at harvard university, told the huffington post over email. a 2012 meta-analysis published in the annals of internal medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said. organic on a budget regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so nestle suggests to just "buy organic to the extent you can, when you can." "organic," on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while "made with organic ingredients" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients. "omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function," wrote study co-author chris seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the u.k.’s newcastle university. pesticides used in strawberry farms in california, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the department of pesticide regulation. "choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue," said gerszberg. other ways of measuring "worth": when considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. a meta-analysis published two years later in the british journal of nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds. "it is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food," advised deborah gerszberg, a nutritionist at columbia university’s pancreas center, in a blog post. organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. buying local food is a community investment, grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key. but as marion nestle, author of food politics and professor of nutrition at new york university, noted, choosing organic has implications for the earth’s well-being, too. it's estimated that the average american meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the center for urban education about sustainable agriculture. "we’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis," said michael crupain, the director of consumer reports’ food safety and sustainability center, in an earlier post. the four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers. there's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. a 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and "substantially higher" levels of antioxidants. a major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are. "the crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor," writes vern grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the university of vermont. "communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses," the nonprofit writes. in addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or csa (community supported agriculture) to get local, in-season produce. producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. last year, a study by market research firm mintel found that a majority of american consumers think organic labeling is merely an "excuse to charge more." "it’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. so choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue. though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? when it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says "100 percent organic" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not. choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. one meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit. according to the environmental working group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the usda in 2014 contained pesticide residues. "when done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability," she told huffpost. "the repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure," said lu. she also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible. for produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable. pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson's to cancer and birth defects. our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients." and there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply): 1. a recent study, published in february, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids. lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large. "livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities." last week, a department of agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic. many mainstream supermarkets, including safeway, target, wal-mart and h-e-b, carry organic store-brand options, while costco, sam's club and bj's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. some supermarkets, like whole foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products. in some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled. the first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). when it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data. the 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. it also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation. the "clean" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. it might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. "some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. organic produce, according to the usda, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. the environmental working group's "dirty dozen" and "clean fifteen" lists are helpful resources on this front. according to food and water watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. "promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods," he said. indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. as for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut. buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. there’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. many organic farms are small operations, though "big organic" farms do exist as well. good housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. sites like all natural savings and organic deals can help customers surface organic food deals. locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative. "it’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly." so, what does this mean for human health? this would be a good second choice," she said. "but getting enough in our diet is difficult. we just don’t know enough about the health effects." in contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less. but is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? the bottom line so is buying organic worth it? buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too. buy in season (and local, if possible). so is buying organic worth it? is buying organic really worth it? the urban organic gardener website's got you covered. it just requires a bit of effort and patience. but organic farming still isn't perfect. keep an eye out for sales and coupons. the answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. those values are important to me." "organics are about production values. depending on your priorities, it might be. what the heck does organic mean anyway? grow your own food. live in a small apartment? these include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower. here, we explore this hotly contested issue. 3. prioritize your purchases. 4. 2. 5.

but executives at lego are hoping to ramp up production in time for this year's christmas season, goodwin said: share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link everything has been a bit too awesome for the world's most profitable toymaker, which is struggling to keep up with demand for its building blocks. "we are working very closely with our retail partners to ensure that as we go into the important holiday season, the back half of 2016, that we've got all of the levers pulled to get back on the growth trajectory." the surprising reason lego wanted people to stop buying its toys business has been so brisk at the world's most profitable toymaker that lego did something unusual last year: it began looking for ways to discourage customers from buying its products. "in the past decade we have seen lego sales growth in the double digits year after year," goodwin said in a statement in october. it simply couldn't make enough toys to satiate demand in north america, and needed a break while it boosted capacity at its factories and increased its workforce by nearly a quarter. the company's revenue has increased by an average of 15 per cent a year in the past 12 years, according to reuters. it has also taken on iconic architecture: a 2989-piece model of the sydney opera house is for sale on lego's website for $399.99, while a 561-piece white house set sells for $89.99. overall, lego's revenue rose 11 per cent to roughly $us2.35 billion in the first half of the year, ahead of the $us1.83 billion reported by mattel, the maker of barbie. lego also hired 3500 employees in the first half of the year, increasingly its workforce to 18,500, according to the wall street journal. the company is buildings its first factory in china, and is expanding existing plants in mexico, hungary and denmark. the danish company scaled back its advertising efforts amid a 25 per cent rise in annual sales, according to reuters. sales in the americas remained flat during the first half of 2016, according to the news agency. and the company's dominance has extended into the company's seven legoland theme parks, 125 retail stores and dozens of video games. the company has released thousands of sets of its eponymous blocks, forging licensing deals with popular brands including star wars, angry birds and disney princesses. lego, a family-owned company founded in denmark in 1932, has enjoyed booming growth for decades. [but] the high demand also puts a strain on our factories around the world." "we feel we need to invest, to build some breathing space," lego's finance chief john goodwin explained. the efforts to quell demand seem to have worked - at least temporarily. the lego movie, a full-length movie released in 2014, brought in $us468.2 million ($610.4 million) at the box office. (revenue in asia and europe, meanwhile, continued to grow by double digits.) a replica of the ghostbusters firehouse, meanwhile, is listed for $499.99. the washington post the washington post the washington post "we are of course very excited about this development.

"i think this one is straight down the pike for the fans," said spielberg, who would not reveal plot details, with one exception: "the one thing i will tell you is i’m not killing off harrison [ford] at the end of it." well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told the hollywood reporter that he is not only "super excited" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be indiana jones! that’s great news for fans who would likely balk at such an idea, the same way they would be furious if james bond accidentally slipped in the shower and cracked his skull at the end of a (hypothetical) final 007 movie. "the opportunity to work with steven again on this character which has brought pleasure to so many... not to mention me," harrison ford said previously. even if this turns out to be the last time ford puts on the bullwhip and fedora, it doesn’t mean the filmmakers have to have the death-defying character bite the dust. john williams is expected to once again provide the music, while screenwriter david koepp (indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull, jurassic park) is signed to pen the script. franchise veterans kathleen kennedy and frank marshall will produce indiana jones 5, which will see both harrison ford and steven spielberg return to the franchise. it’s great fun to work with steven, i’m looking forward to it." "it’s fun, it’s great fun to play this character. the movie is set for a july 19, 2019 release date.

(it’s conceivable that the byers’ and co. wanted to have a new beginning in a town without terrifying government operatives at every turn, but given that adorable little william coughs up a slug at the end, they’re not escaping the past anytime soon.) "i think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,"ross duffer revealed to 2. these are the people coming right back at you, so you can continue to live life: joyce, woman of light bulb chats (winona ryder); mike (finn wolfhard), whose love for eleven was huge; and dustin (gaten matarazzo), the kid who says everything you can’t, but the writer-directors were cryptic about eleven . "i think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,"ross duffer revealed to ew . and i think one of the reasons his sequels are as successful as they are is he makes them feel very different without losing what we loved about the original. until then you’ll have to hold onto your wrist rockets, but the duffer brothers did give entertainment weekly teasers about the show to get everyone all jacked up for the new season. bringing the show’s 4.bringing the show’s tally of cool guys the duffer brothers admire up to 6 million, the new season will have a heavy james cameron influence. "i know movie sequels get a lot of s—, but the ones we look up to aspire to pivot and do something different," he says. "there’s going to be a lot of new and interesting dynamics that we didn’t see in season 1," matt duffer says. there will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. we want to make sure it’s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it’s never treading water. so fingers crossed barb’s mom can lose one more kid the show can drop like a bad habit, in case that family didn’t endure enough misery. 7 things we know about the new season of stranger things + read article netflix officially announced that a second season of stranger things will premiere in 2017. so we’ve opened up this doorway, and to us it’s exciting to talk about, like, what else is behind there? so i think we kinda looked to him and what he does and tried to capture a little bit of the magic of his work." we really don’t go in there much until they go in to find will at the end. "we obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of hawkins. and a lot of questions there in terms of, if the monster is dead, was it a singular monster? but for us, there’s still more story here, there’s still things that are unresolved." great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. we want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1. i think if we extend it too much, it will have a very different feel." this way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. so plan accordingly by getting all your friends the correct walkie talkies to discuss the finer points of steve’s hair. it will be a continuation of the first season’s story. "we don’t know about eleven," ross duffer says. watch the teaser above, and here’s what we know so far. "i think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. we’ll never let go courtesy of netflix stranger things 5. there’s one more major influence that will inspire this season. in the teaser, we see the words "the lost brother." the action’s going to pick back up in fall of 1984. season two will open on another town, the creators reveal. there’s a lot more mystery there to be solved." "we’re letting the story dictate it," says matt. they assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. i guess a lot of this is james cameron. "that’s something we batted around from the very beginning. disappointingly, no mention of whether the show’s heartthrob dr. brenner lived to melt our hearts another day. good old monster-infested hawkins won’t be the only location. everyone will still have access to the upside down. we’ll never let go, barb.

sitting on a leather couch in park city, utah with a bloody mary by his side, slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed, "god’s pocket," which premiered at this year's sundance film festival. the huffington post joined slattery couch-side to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen, how surfing keeps him from getting "a little screwy" and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time. when i was told i couldn’t have it, i thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven’t done anything with it i’m just going to write it anyway. i’d like to try it sometime, but you’d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn’t feel like "oh i shouldn’t have done this." so even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn’t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman. you get to a point where you’re young and you’re an actor and everything is always about "if i could just get this," "if i could only get that." the dark comedy needs a better adjective than "dark," because most of the film reveals deeply-rooted sadness, disappointment and failures –- carried out to perfection by a dream-team cast that includes philip seymour hoffman, christina hendricks, richard jenkins and john turturro. then i mentioned it to christina because i was directing an episode of "mad men" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. "mad men" star took 10 years to make this movie after years of playing roger sterling on amc’s "mad men," john slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand. so i said, all right i’m going to outline this thing, because i had written a shitty screenplay in between and i didn’t want to do that again. at the end of the day, i’d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and i wouldn’t feel crazy that day. some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. i hadn’t gotten phil to officially commit yet so i said here’s the script, i’d love you to play this part and i hope to get phil. i sent him the script and i anticipated that he would let me down easy and say i like it but i don’t have time. but it’s a good thing i didn’t get the rights, because i probably wouldn't be able to actually make a good movie then. and then john turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. when you’re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, i would do this. she realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. because you know what you’re doing on one side of the camera and know what you’re doing on the other. there’s a scene where christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. he’s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that’s not going very well. all these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it’s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. i think there’s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. you really recognize what they’re capable of doing and i should be so lucky to be able to work with those guys. i said, okay let’s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. and in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away, letting it happen. do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn’t have it at first? i’m sure there are all kinds of reasons –- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. she needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he’s trying but they’re missing each other. mickey’s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. i read the book by pete dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it. i was making "the adjustment bureau" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. i got asked if i was going to, and every time i said no, people were like, "good idea." but when it really comes down to it, it’s because you recognize what they do. for "mad men" we’re in new york so i have a place i go surfing in long island. she knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. another example of directors starring in movies is here at sundance –- zach braff’s new film "wish i was here." i did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. you go through the proper channels because you don’t want to burden anybody with "do me a favor." slattery has directed five episodes of "mad men" but this is his first attempt at a feature. he feels that if i lose this woman then i’ll never get anybody else like that. and the dialogue, by which i mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. creative people go on vacation and four days in you’re like i gotta get out of here. i sort of see things in pictures -- i don’t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. she slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film. you watch other people do their thing and you think, "i could do this. ben affleck -- i have to say, i admire the hell out of that guy with a move like "argo." like woody allen, i mean i would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is woody allen. he called and said, "i love the script, but i want to play mickey." what i think you get from christina’s performance is the disappointment she feels. did you just ask christina hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie? about five years later, someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book? it’s the same if i were acting in a play or directing. you mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different. it takes place in mickey’s head, which was difficult to do in a film. if i sit around and do nothing for a while, i get a little screwy. it was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything. and it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. what i wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. and then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. so it was like are you going to watch tv or do this? what did you find most compelling about the material in "god’s pocket"? he knows what he knows and he has the time he has. [laughs] which i was like, "what the hell do you mean by that?" that’s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -– being in it. and then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. she condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. i ask because you’ve directed a handful of "mad men" episodes. i’m interested in zach taking 10 years to do this. but there’s all kinds of gear now, it’s like skiing almost. it sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. do you have a different itch that’s satisfied by writing versus acting? i tried getting the rights but someone else owned them. [warning: plot spoilers throughout] when did you originally come across the material for "god’s pocket"? but then he doesn’t give her what she wants. to direct it and then give that kind of performance. there’s actor a, b, c and then there’s phil hoffman. about 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. i had sent it with an offer for the part of shelburne. i don’t know how the hell he dealt with that stress. i sent it to richard jenkins who is represented by my agent. and richard jenkins and christina hendricks and john turturro. after you had put all that time into it! i don’t want to be a movie star. i have a lot of energy, so i’m told. she needs to find out what happened to her son. you also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. you have to show that, you can’t tell it. what do you think you bring to the table now? based on the theater’s applause on opening night, his future as a director certainly looks bright. what made you want to make this film? if she had said stop, they would have stopped. it’s very visual, which appealed to me. and if someone else makes it first, fine. i think just seeing more of everything. how did you cast this film? so i said all right, in. this is what i do well. i don’t do everything well. i’m not a movie star. that’s also a testament to you. eventually bob gersh from the gersh agency worked out the deal. i went to phil [seymour hoffman] first. did you consider acting in the film? turns out the rights were then available. i can’t play everything. and the fact that they said yes . i can try at this." so i let it go. the rights were not available. and she needs something. your aspirations become more your own. i surf a lot. in the winter it is. same people still owned it. he can’t express himself. the book is very interior. you live in l.a.? that’s a drag. like a kid almost. that was a challenge. i was just floored. isn’t that freezing? half the time. she was thrilled. no. life.
buying a used car comes with some risks: despite all the inspections and certifications, you’re forever a little curious about what the car went through before you put the key in the ignition for the first time. the guy bought a used car through the local police department, thinking he’d get a great deal on a car that had been confiscated. when he tore through the plastic on the inside of the door, he noticed something... a black bag, hidden inside. when this guy bought a used car, he never thought he’d find this hidden inside. and by "load up on lotto tickets," i mean turn the money over to the authorities, of course. but what one guy found inside the used car he had recently purchased goes beyond what anyone’s wildest imagination could conjure up. what would you do if something like this ever happened to you? the car needed some fixing, so in order to save money, he tried to do the repairs himself. i, for one, would load up on lotto tickets. the buyer initially posted his story anonymously online, but later deleted the post out of fear that the previous owner would be able to track him down. unwrapping them revealed the last thing he’d ever expected to find: stacks upon stacks of bills. inside the bag were brick-like objects covered in tape. he chose to hide his identity for obvious reasons. as in, money. probably a smart move. lots of it.
also car matching description of ucla gunman's vehicle is found in culver city estranged wife of ucla shooter died of multiple gunshot wounds, coroner says after hearing a plea for mercy, jurors will decide if 'grim sleeper' should face death updates: 10:10 a.m. his slick move was visible only in slow-motion replays — appearing as a shadow across the driver’s door of the white vehicle. see the most-read stories this hour >> there, he slowed his vehicle in a tree-covered section of the road. 4:31 p.m.: this post was updated with details about the driver’s arrest. l.a. county sheriff’s deputies flooded the area around blue sky and hollytree roads with weapons drawn, searching for the man until he was found. the ingenious way this driver briefly escaped a police pursuit under the nose of choppers televised police chases are pretty common in los angeles. some chase observers gave the man points for ingenuity because his escape was difficult to see live. at one point, he looked up and waved at tv choppers broadcasting the chase. authorities — and tv news helicopters — were tracking a man in a car stolen in lakewood. this post was updated with more details about chase. but minutes later, the man, who was wearing a tony romo dallas cowboys football jersey, was taken into custody, his mad scramble for freedom stopped short. but a driver escaping from a pursuit is much more rare. as the honda accord kept moving, he climbed almost imperceptibly out of the driver’s window. the man drove recklessly for nearly an hour, hitting an armored car and another vehicle. this story was first published at 4:13 p.m. and it appeared to happen friday — at least for a while. the vehicle coasted to a stop farther down the road. authorities have not identified the man or said whether anyone was hurt during his two accidents. it appeared the man might have gotten away. he ended up in the hills above whittier, along turnbull canyon road.
#shocking school van driver raped children in his car a 35-year-old man from bhiwandi who used his four-wheeler to ferry school children, has been arrested for allegedly raping two minor girls for the last six months, police said today. it was only after the teachers enquired with the parents of the victims about their absence from the school, the offence came to the light. the accused has been charged under sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the indian penal code and under relevant sections of protection of children from sexual offences (pocso) act-2012, he said, adding, further probe was on. the accused molested and raped the victims, aged around 8 to 9, on several occasions inside his suv and also at some other secluded places in the past six months, the officer said. it is suspected that manera might have sexually abused more girls travelling in his car and as of now only two have disclosed about the offence. the parents then informed the school authority about it and subsequently a case was lodged by a teacher," jadhav said.

while studying for a masters in design and environment at goldsmiths, university of london, in the last academic year she won a slew of titles including a gold medal at the british universities championships in the women’s coxed four. "on behalf of everyone at bucs, i wish to extend our condolences to the family and friends of ailish and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time." lee boucher, the british team manager in poznan, said: "it is with great sadness that i have to report that our teammate ailish has passed away in hospital in poznan surrounded by her family. a spokesman said: "ailish was involved in an accident after the culmination of the 2016 fisu world university championships for rowing in poznan on sunday evening. "she was a great example to younger members and starting next year without her is hard to imagine at the moment, especially as she had been elected vice-captain. not only was ailish a top oarswoman with a significant future in the international side of the sport, but she also lit up the club with her humour and laughter. irish rower dies in freak accident hours after winning medal a talented irish rower has died after falling in a freak accident just hours after winning a bronze medal at the world university championships in poland. the 23-year-old post-graduate student was a member of the university of london boat club and had recently been elected its vice-captain. ailish sheehan won the podium place with her three teammates in the british women’s four crew in poznan last sunday. our condolences and thoughts are with ailish’s family and friends at this very difficult time." sheehan slipped into a coma and on friday afternoon died in hospital in poznan with her parents, john and catherine, and sisters, niamh and aine, by her bedside. "bucs, british rowing and rowing ireland are providing support to her family during this difficult time and ask for their privacy to be respected. "ailish’s family take comfort in knowing that she didn’t suffer and that she was happy in her final moments." by the time she graduated four years later she was a member of their first varsity eight team. the club’s chief coach, phil gray, said the rising star had a "significant future" in the the sport. he added: "like her performances on the water, ailish gave everything right until the very end, but unfortunately she was unable to win this battle. "our thoughts at this time are with all of her family and friends." the limerick-born rower won an athletic scholarship to the prestigious university of notre dame in indiana in 2011. tributes also poured in from from british universities & college sport (bucs) – the governing body for higher education sport in the uk. in a statement he said: "the whole club is devastated by this news. her family had held a vigil by her bed throughout her six-day stay in the polish hospital. "but our main thoughts are with ailish’s family, who obviously meant so much to her." a spokesman from goldsmiths said: "we are shocked and saddened at this tragic news. while celebrating the win with teammates she fell, suffering catastrophic injuries.
if we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear: our sense of self-worth can be worsened we risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress we are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved the increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: the impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety. step 4: enjoy the process maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins: step 1: start small first of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. there is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal. by celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal. for example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. you can be mentally stronger if you do this small act every day as humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them. by focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. so, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends. for every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. as psychologist karl weick suggests in his article "small wins," we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. by appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don’t achieve the ultimate goal. understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health. the dangers of dreaming big we are encouraged on a daily basis to "dream big" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals. this will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem. it sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. by doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions. step 3: reward yourself from early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. so often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. by taking the alcoholics anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. step 2: reflect often every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. this phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only. if the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. that gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. this means comparing yourself — with yourself. endorsed by ricky tang editor love this

this u.s. city will soon have the nation's most-taxed cigarettes taxes on cigarettes are rising yet again in chicago with a 50-cent increase that makes smokes in the windy city the most highly-taxed in the country. the city, however, is still cracking down on smoking in other ways: emanuel and a few key aldermen are reportedly looking to heavily restrict e-cigarette use in the city with rules that would effectively ban them from public spaces. "the cheaper the cigarettes, the more people who are going to buy cigarettes and the more people who are going to die," the american heart association’s mark peysakhovich told the sun-times the day before the city council vote. in combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $7.17 a pack, wgn reports. the $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports. chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than new york city’s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation. according to emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the tribune reports. jason ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayor's decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside the city. the mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards. chicago's city council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of mayor rahm emanuel's 2014 budget on tuesday. though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from mayor emanuel. "we still create the black market when we raise that bar at any level," ervin told the sun-times. health officials, meanwhile, were dismayed that the tax on cigarettes wasn't higher. ald.
heldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: "it's like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red." an image is sexually objectifying if "yes" is the answer to any of the following questions: does the image show only parts of a sexualized person's body? however, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to heldman: instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. so if there's anything i can pitch to you about why you don't want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure. a spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. "i'd like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering." she added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because american culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable. does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that can't consent? perhaps the most powerful part of the video is the end, where heldman invites us to "imagine a different world," offering viewers tools to navigate, and eventually, change objectification culture. heldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying. the "sexy lie" we should all be talking about "i am here today to talk about a lie." does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? does the image treat a sexualized person's body as a canvas? does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? that's how politics professor caroline heldman opened her jan. 2013 tedxyouth san diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification. does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity? does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? we highly recommend watching.
but despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: it prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's department of public charities and correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed. when cca (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of us taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that shane had "knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to cca by violating its policies," and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. bly—who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best jules verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days—was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. why we sent a reporter to work as a private prison guard read mother jones reporter shane bauer's firsthand account of his four months spent working as a guard at a corporate-run prison in louisiana. we took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons—often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates—dramatically reduced. serialized by joseph pulitzer's new york world, nellie bly's accounts (later collected in a book called ten days in a mad-house) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck—she'd begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled "what girls are good for"—though her ingénue looks couldn't have hurt, either. somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny—even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government. when he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us. when she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, "lunatics" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants. the $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. when abc news busted food lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties—i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! the letter came not from cca's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-lgbt activities. he spent four months as a guard at a cca-run louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking. to see what private prisons are really like, shane bauer applied for a job with the corrections corporation of america. in 1887, a 23-year-old journalist got herself checked into the women's lunatic asylum on blackwell's island in new york city. nondisclosure agreements—once mainly the provenance of people who work on apple product launches and beyoncé videos—are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other "non-disparagement" clauses and "employer protection statutes." companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny. there's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by poynter ethicist bob steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. he used his own name and social security number, and he noted his employment with the foundation for national progress, the publisher of mother jones. there is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there. if you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to mother jones to help underwrite our investigations. there is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there. when the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story. but here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. mac mcclelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for mother jones. when the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception. but while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. when is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? ted conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did ben bagdikian, for whom mojo's fellowship program is named. shane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed. in 1961, john howard griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the united states. i'll paraphrase: when the information obtained is of vital public interest. but don't let anyone distract you from the story itself. or when, for that matter, they replace the government. access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. barbara ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. when other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted. because the story itself is revealing as hell. first, there's a real concern over ethics. after meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues. when the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused. he did not lie. or the last. why?
child health advocates gathered on capitol hill wednesday to mark the release of a new report, "the first 1,000 days: nourishing america’s future," which documents the scourge of malnutrition in the u.s. 1,000 days, a nonprofit that advocates nationally and globally for better early nutrition, produced the report, which highlights the economic gap that prevents many families from meeting some of the world health organization’s basic nutritional standards. "half of the babies born in this country are participating in women, infants and children program here in the united states," lucy sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 days, said on capitol hill wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as wic. sadly, this is the top vegetable 1-year-olds in america eat nutrition during the 1,000 days between a child’s conception and their second birthday is critical to their future success, dictating both brain and physical development. hugh welsh, the president of dsm, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the u.s. about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients. lucy sullivan, executive director of 1,000 days barbara bush, daughter of former president george w. bush and the ceo and co-founder of global health corps, stressed the irreversibility of the first 1,000 days. "that’s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the u.s. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country," she added. advocates said they were pleased the usda and the department of health and human services have started to develop the first-ever dietary guidelines for children under the age of 2, but those standards are not expected until 2020. the report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don’t receive enough iron in their diet. experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese american adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems. the report highlights a number of factors: nearly half of u.s. women gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy, which can lead to higher rates of obesity in children. they can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs. in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form. "this has to be a commitment to putting kids, and their need for access to food and nutrition, in the front of the agenda," casey said. "the most devastating part is when you are 2 years old and younger, you don’t have a lot of control over your life," she said. he called for a marshall plan for the children of america, much like the billions of dollars in economic support the u.s. gave to europe after wwii. bush echoed those calls to action, stressing that america’s children need access to these fundamental nutrients as they grow. "it will impact everything you do, whether that be how you learn or if you can learn fully and all of your mechanisms to engage in life." those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed. and yet the vegetable american toddlers are most likely to eat is a french fry. and only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the who recommends due to breastmilk’s unparalleled nutritional properties. rep. lynn jenkins (r-kan.) echoed bush: "these children are losing the chance to reach their full potential before they even get started." the panel and congressional leaders highlighted the need for legislation about increased nutritional information and paid family leave. without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child’s brain may never form all its potential synapses. "i could travel to malawi, and everyone there would understand, but i could travel to milwaukee and no one would understand what i was talking about with micronutrients," he said. "but it can have an impact on your life in perpetuity." that doesn’t even begin to address all the economic factors at play. the face of hunger and malnutrition looks like america." the face of hunger and malnutrition looks like america. "you can’t catch up," she told the huffington post. "it is all of us. sen. bob casey (d-pa.) said the issue requires bipartisan action.
using carbon-dating, rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. so when she learned about bruniquel cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?" on one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. a shocking find in a neanderthal cave in france in february 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named bruno kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of bruniquel cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. "when you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven," adds verheyden. perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? "when i announced the age to jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible," says verheyden. the structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. "the neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought," the team writes. "when i announced the age to jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible." "when you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious." some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. by measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. and if rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. after drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. "i’m not very big, and i had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through," says verheyden. carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of france at the time: neanderthals. "a plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior," says paola villa from the university of colorado museum. more than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. the walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). the cave sits in france’s scenic aveyron valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. a life-long caver, verheyden works at the royal belgian institute of natural sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. he eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. she treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. these weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. she knew that rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. to get a better estimate, verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist jacques jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert dominique genty. by comparison, the bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient. it also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of homo sapiens. most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. in 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. there simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. with his death, work on the bruniquel cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones. outside bruniquel cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. the discovery suggested that neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. they were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist francois rouzaud. there were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. they wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. nor is it clear how the neanderthals made the structures. why did they build the rings and mounds? most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. in april 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. they’ve only now re-entered the limelight because sophie verheyden went on holiday. indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. they could well have been much older. "it’s kind of magical, even without the structures." they broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. they found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. neanderthals must have been responsible. others had been propped up against these donuts. 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. they were built by people. yet others had been stacked into four piles. the floor was pockmarked with pools of water. they used fire, too. their date? rouzaud would never know.
this woman crashed her car, the reason why is pretty ridiculous according to gomez, the reason why she crashed her car, whilst travelling from cali to the city of pereira, was because she got distracted by her own ‘erotic thoughts.’ now that’s not an excuse you hear every day. it’s not every day you come across a porn star, especially whilst you’re at work. i wonder if the happy rescuers asked gomez about her upcoming live porn movie – which is due to air in august. they comforted gomez after she lost control of her vehicle, by taking a few photos with her. i want to give peace to all those who love me and worry about me. following the incident, the adult film star posted online: "i just came off the road, this happens to me for going around having erotic dreams, jejejejeje. personally, i smell bullsh*t here, but the emergency services and the tow company who were called to the accident weren’t complaining. in other super sexy news, you’ve got to check out the video on the next page. so let’s carry on enjoying life with more zest and love than ever. i love you all." it will leave you drooling. i imagine they did. to be fair, who can blame them? thank god i am safe and sound.

overall, cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while j.r. smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. it was going to be hard — coach tyronn lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions — but the cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory. it certainly appears that it's going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so — the kind of changes that look beyond lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the "tougher plays" as the reasons behind his team's blowout loss sunday. the warriors have now won seven consecutive games against the cavs — three straight to claim last season's title, twice in the 2015-16 regular season, and now twice in these nba finals — and in each effort, the cavs have found themselves further and further from victory. if anything, the warriors have given the cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: in game 1, the splash brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. the cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in nba finals history — the warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games — and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls. the warriors made 15 3-pointers while the cavs made 5 on sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point warriors win — the seventh-largest margin of victory in nba finals history. the cavs came into sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the eastern conference playoffs with ease. the cavaliers have been taught the simple truth seven times now — all warriors wins — and yet they have not come to the understanding that they cannot take 2s and expect to beat 3s. it has to do with kyrie irving and kevin love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. the simple reason the cavs can't win the nba title the cavs then saw the simple truth play out twice more in the regular season. the cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it. it has to do with the cavs needing j.r. smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. and because the lesson has not been learned, another simple truth has come forward: the cavaliers cannot win these nba finals. it has to do with cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time. the warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one. it has to do with the cavs daring draymond green to beat them and then him doing just that. it has to do with the warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the eastern conference. those were windows — the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the cavs couldn't take advantage of it. it has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2. instead, the cavs shot two more 3-pointers in game 2 compared to game 1. not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as lebron james said in his postgame press conference — 50-50 balls. and again in game 2 of the nba finals sunday. then again in game 1 of the nba finals. how do the cavs win a game in this series? it has to do with the warriors' elite defense. in game 2, golden state turned the ball over 20 times. they are prolific and ruthless — a juggernaut of the highest order. nothing about these warriors' wins has been flukey. frankly, they'd be lucky to win a game. the simple truth loomed too large. this is what they do. they made two fewer.
though the manhattan eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in california and d.c.) "every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days. the future of fast food has arrived and it's a one-of-a-kind experience we've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa. "there are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process," explained scott bruggman, an eatsa corporate trainer who began as an r&d chef creating bowls. eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first east coast location (in new york) on wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience. to the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. millennials, such as sabina m. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. this all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. "so this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but i think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme." since there was no one to take my order, i made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. once i put in my request for a hummus & falafel bowl, i walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. "where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. as of right now, bruggman described the tech and human ratio as "a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick." marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at disney world, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the eatsa kitchen. the food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass "cubby" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. though i initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant i was instantly greeted by a friendly eatsa "mascot." marsh, director of market operations for easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. "maybe it’s just because of the novelty," she said, "but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy. with the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal. her boyfriend, powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. "there’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience." "i definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community," bryke said. instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, "it's coming." so with a mind full of skepticism mashable headed down to the newly opened midtown manhattan location to see what all the hype is about. after you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice. the tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: it replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots. to get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, gen x-er and first-time customer, maarten nederlof gave mashable his two-cents. much like apple geniuses, eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. while one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. though i was satisfied with the space-age experience, i couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. i turned to dean marsh, director of market operations for the east coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. "i think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working." "people already order seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. first-time customers and vegetarians madee bryke and her boyfriend andrew powell also had their theories. we’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the mcdonalds and starbucks of the world," he said. while this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. "we’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction," he said. we feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people," he said. despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. so it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another." right before your food arrives in your cubby, eatsa fills you with intrigue. the process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised. "there are people back there; i know that," bryke said. this means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? it’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways." perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there. "the eatsa bots are back there," bruggman said. the concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. "are you really missing out on that much?" tbh, it felt like something straight out of the jetsons. bryke and powell, also millennials, agreed. therefore it's the best of both worlds. this was the moment of truth. what's next? he questioned. zap. very ominous.

"young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education," said rory o'sullivan, policy and research director at young invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates. fifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the united states a "major problem," according to survey results released exclusively to the huffington post on tuesday by the harvard university institute of politics. segal noted that george washington university, for instance, is currently building a $130 million "super dorm" on campus, and students at the university of pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers. new york -- a majority of young americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem. this phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isn't limited to private schools, either: iowa state university recently spent $46.2 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the university of california-davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls. o'sullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now it's important to explain why student debt is big and "what it is we need to fix it." although o'sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. but policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nation's $1.2 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole. a 2012 new york federal reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. a plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. however, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nation's outstanding student debt. survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school. more than 7 in 10 in the harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college. the cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment. only 8 percent of harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt. "too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students," segal said. young invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill. most millennials believe student debt is a "major" problem—and this is who they blame. matthew segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit ourtime.org, was "pleasantly surprised" to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges. the huffington post collaborated with the harvard institute of politics on questions asked of college-age americans. "people are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs," segal said. yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue. only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a "minor problem." a previous huffington post/yougov poll found most americans believe state universities are no longer affordable. "we invest less than we used to, per student," o'sullivan noted. a larger update to harvard's biennial study of younger americans will be publicly released wednesday. the u.s. department of education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone.
tel aviv – the sister of a palestinian terrorist who plowed his truck into a group of soldiers in jerusalem on sunday, killing four and wounding 16, said the family was "thankful" for his "most beautiful martyrdom." gaza-based terror group hamas on sunday praised the attack as a "heroic" act and encouraged other palestinians to do the same and "escalate the resistance." qanbar rammed his truck into a crowd of cadets and officers who were touring the promenade overlooking the old city of jerusalem in the southern neighborhood of armon hanatziv. shadia said her brother was not a member of any terror group and had acted on his own. he also suggested a connection between sunday’s attack and the truck rammings in berlin and nice last year. hamas spokesman abdul-latif qanou said the truck-ramming attack showed that the wave of palestinian violent "resistance" against israel has not ceased. all four of the soldiers who died were in their twenties, and three of them were women. according to eyewitnesses, after the terrorist ran his flatbed truck over the soldiers, he reversed over them a second time. it is the most beautiful kind of saintly death," fadi al qanbar’s sister shadia, 28, told palestinian media. at least nine people have been arrested in connection with the attack, mostly members of the qanbar family. in the coastal enclave, palestinians were photographed giving out sweets to passing drivers in celebration of the attack. she added that qanbar, a father of four, was devoutly religious. we are patient and we thank allah for this," she added. "praise be to allah that he became a martyr. prime minister benjamin netanyahu said there are signs qanbar may have supported the islamic state. "it may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end," he said. "allah chose him for this martyrdom. thank god. family values.

perhaps ms chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death. shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but ms chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters. as a graduate of taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, ms chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in taiwan. high kill rate taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce. "she often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better," winnie lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in taoyuan city, remembers. the chief of the animal protection section of the council of agriculture, chiang wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately. and even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered. budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (£100). the shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by ms chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down. you might also be interested in in an interview ms chien once did with a local tv station cti, she described the first time she saw an animal put down. newspapers accused the government of "murdering" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing. but a letter ms chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for ngos to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays. in the letter, ms chien wrote: "i hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. she cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her," said ms lai. in reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions. the authorities say this is nothing to do with ms chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy. short-term measures ms chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force. the taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter. but people also asked why frontline workers in taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure. on 5 may last year, ms chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. it comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short. when it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the "beautiful slaughterer". 'please value life' a new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in taiwan. many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law. some accused "higher-level bureaucrats" of trying to convince the public that ms chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. the irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out. they say we love to kill and are cruel," said kao yu-jie, one of her co-workers. in the cti interview, ms chien described the process of putting a dog down. the government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. but the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. i hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... you hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough." "when you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. but other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility. perhaps veterinarian and animal lover chien chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time. "we first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. and about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness. ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem." all of taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff," said mr chiang. her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide. she said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in taiwan. some taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. but it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. from 4 february 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. but after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in taiwan. "she put herself under a lot of pressure. no psychological counselling was provided for the staff. others want to breed to give to friends or sell. in some shelters, half the animals are killed. but many see these as short-term measures. then we take it into the 'humane room'. "but people still abandon their dogs. "i went home and cried all night," she said. "we are very short-staffed. the work is difficult and hours long. "they called her a butcher... we are frequently scolded. some people say we'll go to hell. in 2015 around 10,900 were put down. "it's a systematic problem. actually, it's very sad." the bbc's cindy sui explores this tragedy. it no longer shakes. please value life."
the boone police department charged the women with seven counts of misdemeanor graffiti and one count of damaging personal property, the observer reported. boone police chief dana crawford said a tip from high country crime stoppers led to the arrests. the women, 22-year-old taryn bledsoe, 22-year-old julia grainger, 22-year-old elizabeth prier, and 21-year-old hannah seay, of boone, were arrested late last week after the graffiti spree took place jan. 21, the fayetteville observer reported. police arrested four women in north carolina for allegedly spraying anti-trump, anti-police, and "black lives matter" graffiti on several businesses and a police car. i would also like to thank high country crime stoppers for their invaluable service." "i stated this case was a priority for us," crawford said to fox news. "thanks to the involvement of citizens who came forward, we resolved this case in short order. police said the women caused about $10,000 worth of damage. i applaud the community for their overwhelming response. so woke!
the father of a 14-year-old girl who was the father of a 14-year-old girl who was killed in a speedboat accident said she predicted her death in her final text message to him. this teen's last text before she died may have predicted her tragic fate you and 3.2m others like this. her mom, debbie, added, we want speedboat drivers to have compulsory licenses and for it to be the law that all passengers wear proper-fitted life jackets. we’ll make it our mission to ensure safeguards are on the statute books to stop similar tragedies and to prevent those left behind from falling apart like we have. one of the straps got caught on the speedboat as it capsized, trapping her underwater for around half an hour. emily was wearing a buoyancy aid when the tragedy took place — not a life jacket. just hours before her death, emily sent a message to her dad with a wave and sleeping face emoji. emily gardner (pictured far right above), from the uk, drowned after becoming trapped under a capsized boat. the family is now calling for tighter restrictions on privately owned boats and stronger maritime regulations in the uk. i’m not a superstitious person but after what happened, the text makes sense to me. she was on vacation in the town of brixham without her parents when the horror unfolded. now i think it was some sort of premonition. he said, it was the very last time i heard from emily. clive gardner clive, 44, believes it was "some sort of premonition." you and 3.2m others like this. it felt so strange to me.
ava, who has had 14 surgeries, got to hang with the players last week, received a signed helmet and all kinds of goodies and attended the team's game on dec. 21. well, given watson's $622,948 salary for this season, his weekly paycheck for the 17-week season comes out to almost $37,000 before taxes, according to pro football talk. football player donates a week's paycheck to sick little girl, makes her season bright menelik watson of the oakland raiders just earned our all-pro honors -- for incredible generosity. "with federal and california taxes consuming roughly half of that amount, the net check would have been in the range of $18,000," the outlet went on to note. he pulled ava's father aside and told him he was donating a week's paycheck to the family. the raiders were visited recently by ava urrea, a 4-year-old who was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome -- which interrupts normal blood flow through the heart. on sunday, watson didn't tweet about the donation, though he did mention the raiders' upset victory over the buffalo bills. one called his donation a selfless act that was way bigger than football. with ava in attendance, the raiders triumphed, 26-24. h/t for the win h/t for the win h/t for the win and he just got bigger in the eyes of many. fans deluged his account with praise for what he had done off the field. but watson went the extra yard -- well, way beyond that. it was all arranged through the touchdown dreams children's charity run by fox sports reporter jay glazer. 71 (pictured below earlier in the season) is a large man. and now we know that santa claus can wear silver and black, too. just how much money is that? (he did not play.) at 6 feet, 5 inches and 310 pounds, no.

new overwatch hero announced and it’s not who you expected new overwatch hero announced and it’s not who you expected overwatch fans will be excited to hear that a new hero has just been announced to join the roster and help in the fight for saving the world. she states in her origin video that she didn’t want the same life for pharah as she’d had, although i’d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless. looking to the future, it’ll be interesting to see how ana affects the game’s balance, and just who, or what, else blizzard has up their sleeve. for a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp. turns out she is pharah’s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the overwatch team. you can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper. now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. much like other heroes, ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it’s a goodie. ana’s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect. ana’s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. ana taught pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. however, don’t be disheartened, as you’re in for a lot of fun. maybe sombra will make an appearance in a future release? sorry to those who thought it would be. maybe sombra was just a complete ruse? well, this new hero isn’t sombra. ana, the kickass heal-sniper. this new hero’s name? ana. only time will tell.
a day after lebron james called him a "hater" and dug up some of his personal history, tnt analyst charles barkley says he stands by his criticism of the cleveland cavaliers' star player. james, clearly irked by barkley's comments, told espn's dave mcmenamin on monday night that he won't let barkley "disrespect my legacy like that," and took some personal shots at the hall of famer.

orlando coroner did something unusual with shooter’s body to honor the 49 victims while hundreds of thousands have shown their love and support for the victims of the orlando massacre, the local coroner’s office just did their own act of support in a way only they could. dr. joshua stephany is the chief medical examiner for the case and just released a statement explaining why they broke protocol in placing the murderer’s body: "the pulse shooter was transported separately from the scene. stephany then went on to say that they’re responsible for not only the police department, but the families of the victims, and he takes that responsibility very seriously. this is not a law or requirement, but was rather done out of respect for the victims and their families so that the shooter may never be near the 49 beautiful souls again." he built personalized crosses for each victim and then proceeded to drive 1,200 miles to orlando health medical center where he placed the crosses around the hospital. greg zanis is another supporter who went above and beyond to make sure the 49 lives that were taken that night are remembered. the shooter’s autopsy was also conducted in another building, away from the victims. his remains are being held in a separate building at the me facility.
the study, conducted by professor manny noakes, revealed that the enzymes that come with alcohol metabolism can be effected by the consumption of pears, which helps the body metabolize alcohol faster, or even eliminate it. outside of helping with constipation, decreasing inflammation, helping you with cholesterol levels—or just generally being a tasty fruit—pears are reportedly perfect with helping avoid the possibility of a hangover. researchers suggest that korean pear juice is the most effective, and that the most significant impact it has seen is helping subjects' under the influence increase their concentration levels. "in particular, reductions were seen in blood acetaldehyde levels, the toxic metabolic thought to be responsible for hangover symptoms," she says in an interview with quartz. so the next time you want to get some late night, drunk grub, make sure you google map the nearest 24 hour grocery store and grab you and your squad some pears. of course, they should be consumed in advance, preferably towards the end of your long, drunken night, in order to be effective. you won’t believe what it is —&gt; researchers from commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization in australia made a convenient discovery for all of us millennials, and then some. the consumption of the fruit can help reduce alcohol levels significantly.

chinese father realizes his greatest regret after his son dies in car accident 1 share share tweet share share email a father realized one of his biggest regrets after his son’s fatal car crash and is now committed to helping asian immigrant parents avoid his mistake. but it was just the way i shattered his dream when he was small ... and i know for sure, there are other chinese parents who are doing the same to their children right now. while on a trip to china in june last year, paul li received tragic news that his 18-year-old son was one of the victims in a fatal high-speed car wreck. calvin, an extroverted football player and recent graduate at wootton high school, had been admitted to the university of maryland in college park where he would have attended as a freshman. li, a chinese immigrant who arrived to the united states during his twenties, reflected after his son’s passing: "if i knew what i know now, i would’ve been a much better parent. i was just forcefully saying, you know, ‘you’re a chinese kid.’" calvin associated with few other asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn’t academics. the fellowship will be dedicated to studying the kinds of issues facing the children of asian american immigrants involving family dynamics, identity formation and cultural gaps. in march, li established a foundation name for his son and announced that he will be donating $1.2 million over the span of three years for a university of maryland fellowship. on june 25, 2015, sam ellis left a party in north potomac where he had been drinking and crashed his car into another vehicle that killed li’s son, calvin, and a fellow classmate, alex murk. i felt that’s not the right way of dealing with identity, but at the time i was not aware of this issue. li recalled crushing his son’s dreams during his middle school years when he told calvin: "son, you go back to study. janelle wong, the director of asian american studies at university of maryland, believes such families will benefit from the research findings that will be presented at lectures and community workshops. as a teenager, calvin strove to be more americanized and had no interest in eating out at chinese restaurants with his parents, listening to chinese news or traveling to asia. he wanted to break away from the kind of stereotypes that are linked to asian americans such as academic excellence in math and science. "society often thinks, asian kids — they’re doing well in school, they’re working hard they tend to be overachievers, they don’t have any problems. li struggled to understand his son’s avoidance of his cultural heritage and desire to adopt an all-american attitude growing up. but in fact, they do have problems, and many of the problems are overlooked by not only their parents but also by the society." ellis, a one-time star quarterback at wootton high school, pleaded guilty on two charges of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison. li recognized his son’s struggle to reconcile the dual chinese and american cultures in which he was raised. li, an investment analyst from rockville, maryland, had tried convincing his son to join him on his trip to china. li said: "so his [calvin’s] way of doing that was to distance himself from anything chinese. i will work hard, and i will be successful, and you will be proud of me." 7 on his high school football team and once had aspirations of becoming a professional football player. as a child, calvin attended chinese school on the weekends and excelled in mandarin. however, as he grew up, calvin began distancing himself from his parents’ cultural traditions and values. according to washington post, his son declined his offer and told him: "dad, don’t worry about me. even though i know maybe in reality he would not be a football player. you’re not going to be a football player. that moment would become one of his greatest regrets. friends remember calvin as a football fanatic who was charismatic, upbeat and funny. and i don’t want that to happen." i was not understanding enough to help him. he was the wide receiver no.

partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: "sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!" for the last question, the interviewer asked: "a right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. as prashant explains in his post , if the altitude is at a 45-degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10, then the largest the altitude can be is 5, as any higher altitude can’t exist in a right-angled triangle. but now, a former interviewee of microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. he was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect. microsoft applicant shares crazy hard interview question that left him stumped if you're going for an interview at one of the world’s top tech companies, you need to know your stuff. prashant bagdia posted on the website quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at microsoft. google’s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of internet folklore. and nope, he didn’t even get the job in the end. according to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than google's. well, rather deviously, a triangle with those measurements can’t exist. so why would they ask such a question? but his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. find the area of the triangle."

i keep a "dream book" myself, and i’ve filled it with things that are important to me—from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. but knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life—in and out of the workplace—is absolutely key to success. when you’re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, "what am i doing right now that is making me fulfilled?" it even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that’s been on my list of projects to tackle—and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today. this is the difference between a job and a calling i’ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it’s a calling. and often, it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. the answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward. as a result, i believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you. but it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. i’ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. many people start to explore their feelings when they’re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. in corporate culture and performance, authors john kotter and james heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. research from the hay group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. and fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. and more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life. but having purpose doesn’t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. so spend time creating a vision for your life. trust me, your vision can and will change over time. spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? are you helping someone? are you being creative? are you coding?
now he doesn’t know for sure what was going on in that woman’s life, but he made the assumption that it must be something pretty big, and right at that moment, conway got the sudden urge to give that lady a small gift. he went back into the store he was just in, still cranky and mad at his job, but he got that lady a present and said something to her that proves there must be angels in the world. he was having a particularly rough day at work, and he admits that he was busy feeling sorry for himself, but that’s when he looked out of the window of his truck. while some people might think it’s silly, there really are angels among us every single day of the year — all you have to do is know where to look! some of our problems might be bigger than others, but we should always do our best to give a smile to someone else who might be hurting, just so they can do the same for the next person they meet. he's having a bad day at work, but when he looks out of his truck, he spots this... quintin conway is just a normal guy, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be an angel for someone out there in the world! right in that moment of self-pity, he saw a 60-year-old woman sitting alone in her car reading a book. since then, it’s gotten over 3 million views, and it should really remind us all to put things in perspective. she looked lonely and sad, but things got even more emotional for conway when he realized she was completely bald. while he didn’t want to film the video at first, we’re sure glad he did. he might not have wings, but he’s got a big heart!
while every fledgling jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during the force awakens that point to rey being tempted to the dark. while many people believed the final shot was a clue to rey being a skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. there are a few other audio snippets included (luke, obi-wan, and yoda to name a few) but palpatine's inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider luke's lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. in the force awakens, if rey's parentage does stem from palpatine, her battle against kylo ren continues the skywalker/palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. there's even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film's script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film. but when expanded out, rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with kylo ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they're one. a lot of people used rey's british accent as evidence that she could be a kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. rey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. both rey and palpatine are the only two characters in the star wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. in the portrait form, rey's strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. in the film's script, it describes rey as "standing on the edge of the dark side". right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear palpatine's scream, and further along, there's audio of palpatine saying "any jedi". the conclusion of star wars: the force awakens left us all with one question: who are rey's parents? that's because rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. the notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for the force awakens. this mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. this cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of skywalker vs palpatine tension. but a new theory has awakened: that rey is in fact emperor palpatine's granddaughter. youtuber vincent vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it's pretty compelling. during rey's vision, palpatine can be heard several times. this "star wars" theory about rey will blow your mind more like grandpa-lpatine. why else would ol' palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to rey? there's the matter of their fighting styles. finally, what about the accent? for now. palpatine. yep.
a former model starved to death, but not from anorexia in her late 20s, lisa brown had it all—the 5'10" former model married her college sweetheart, had attended grad school, and loved to cook gourmet meals and take spins in a classic mustang convertible. this article originally appeared on newser: former model starved to death—but not from anorexia this article originally appeared on newser: former model starved to death—but not from anorexia this article originally appeared on newser: former model starved to death—but not from anorexia on saturday, after many therapies and surgery, the 34-year-old—who'd dropped down to 77 pounds and entered hospice—died in brookfield, wis. "it's my time to go," she told people last week. by the time she stepped on a scale to check her weight, she was 112 pounds, down from 140 pounds, reported good housekeeping in 2015. brookfield now reported that doctors recommended she get a small intestine transplant, but she was unable to gain the 20 pounds doctors said she'd need to add to her frame in order to have the surgery. brown's husband, patrick, who started a gofundme page to help pay for her memorial and his unpaid leave from work, says the last thing he told her was, "go be free." superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a condition in which her small intestine was being pinched and not allowing food to pass through, and gastroparesis, which kept her stomach from emptying correctly, reports people. brown said she'd gotten countless stares from strangers; some were so bold as to tell her to eat a burger or ask why she was starving herself. brown's story went viral after she posted a video to youtube to offer hope to others fighting similar battles, though her disorder is so rare there are only 400 other reported cases, per people. "it was very hard to hear," she said, "but i knew the truth." but at 28 she began to mysteriously lose weight and vomit after eating.

with the reported $115 million raised from the ice bucket challenge, the als association funded six research projects, one of which recently published its findings: identification of a new gene that contributes to the disease. the idea was to challenge friends to either dump a bucket of ice water over their heads or donate to the als association. according to the bbc, finding the gene can lead to gene therapy treatment for about 10 percent of those with als and allow scientists to better understand the neurodegenerative disease, which affects around 20,000 americans. as you may recall, the ice bucket challenge went viral in the summer of 2014. most popular a lot of people also donated, giving those who denounced the challenge as a viral blip with no real power something to think about. seventeen million wasted buckets of ice water later, we have a breakthrough in als research. a lot of people—over 17 million—got doused in icy water. so, thank you, eager teens and invested celebrities and 50 cent. 50 cent was there. there's power in virality after all. the ice bucket challenge actually ... worked? you remember, you were there. everyone was there.
however, some men can also have them and in that case they are called "apollo holes" they are located in a place where two bones connect the pelvis, and can be found only in people who have this genetic predisposition. the important thing is not to have them for the looks but to be proud of your genetic predisposition for good circulation and health. since "venus holes" are located in a place where there is no muscle, it’s impossible to create them with exercises. these small circles are called "venus holes" and are formed on the lower back of women. the "venus holes" are a sign of good circulation and a healthy body. everyone who has these holes on the back is really special! this is why... science source: http://healthybiofood.com; image source: http://www.spinalmedical.co.uk/back_pain_causes.php; image source: http://www.spinalmedical.co.uk/back_pain_causes.php; however, eliminating some fat can make them a little more visible.

"that's been the secret that i have had through this year that keeps me healthy," naddour told the paper, adding that it had saved him from "a lot of pain". no, not paintballing misadventures or love bites - they are the result of a practice known as "cupping"; an ancient therapy where heated cups are placed on the skin. athletes say they are using it to ease aches and pains, and to help with recovery from the physical toil of constant training and competing. while there have "certainly been satisfied customers for 3,000 years", professor edzard ernst from the department of complementary medicine at the university of exeter previously told the bbc it was not a proven medical treatment. it has published rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained practitioners who are accredited members of their organisation. cupping has also become an increasingly available and popular treatment in beauty parlours and spas, as well as traditional chinese medicine shops where it is commonly on offer. the suction pulls the skin away from the body and promotes blood flow - and leaves those red spots, which typically last for three or four days. belarusian swimmer pavel sankovich also posted a photo of his legs covered in a dozen of the little domes. the mark of an olympic athlete, at least at rio 2016, seems to be a scattering of perfectly round bruises. in 2004, gwyneth paltrow appeared at a film premiere revealing the signs of cupping on her back. the technique, which is a form of acupuncture, is done by lighting flammable liquid in a glass cup. image copyright pavel sankovich instagram the bacc warns that on "rare occasions" the hot cups can cause mild burns. swimmers and gymnasts, particularly from team usa, are among those seen sporting the mysterious dots.

for the last couple of years, people in gaza receive electricity on alternating eight-hour cycles, but for the last four weeks they have only received a maximum of four hours of power a day from the electricity company - a reduction in supply that has come in the middle of particularly cold weather in gaza. on friday, the hamas movement held the government of the palestinian authority, which is based in ramallah in the west bank, and president abbas responsible for the dire electricity crisis in the gaza strip. since then, there has effectively been a division of the palestinian territories, with parts of the west bank controlled by the palestinian authority and its fatah president, mahmoud abbas, and gaza governed by hamas. the associated press said that one of its journalists was arrested, while a photographer for the french news agency afp was reportedly hit in the face by a police officer's gun when he refused to hand over his camera. the unusual protest near gaza's most densely populated place - the jebaliya refugee camp - was one of the largest unauthorised and unplanned protests since hamas reinforced its power in the strip in 2007, when it removed officials from the fatah movement. barhum demanded that abbas, and the fatah movement that he leads, "end this dangerous policy" and end the crisis, which has left gaza with less than a quarter of its required electricity. power battle this week security forces of the palestinian islamist movement hamas have arrested dozens of gaza residents for participating in protests against cuts to the electricity supply. nikolay mladenov, the un special coordinator for the middle east peace process, warned that local residents could not be expected to live with "just a couple of hours of electricity per day in the middle of winter". the two million residents of gaza require around 470-500 megawatts of power per day, but at the moment are receiving less than half of that, according to the spokesman for the electricity supplier, tariq lubbad. 'thank god i am still alive' a video posted on facebook shows demonstrators marching from the centre of the refugee camp to the headquarters of the electricity company. hamas security forces violently dispersed the protesters, with shots fired in the air to clear the crowds and a number of protesters and local journalists assaulted. thousands of angry demonstrators have poured onto the streets, protesting against both the local electricity company and the hamas-run gaza power authority, demanding an immediate solution. the palestinian centre for human rights said that "security personnel in the aftermath of the protest raided several houses and arrested a number of activists". we are only working for three or four hours a day and this, of course, is not enough," sakallah said. "i call for the full respect of the right to freedom of expression, peaceful protest and assembly in gaza," mladenov also said in a statement. local and international organisations have suggested numerous solutions over the past decade to solve the crisis, leading to the reconstruction of the destroyed power station. i was hit by several punches and blows from the police," said ehab elmaghraby, a student who took part in the protest. hamas spokesperson fawzi barhum said that the ongoing power shortage was "intentional" and aimed "to tighten the unfair siege on gaza and create chaos and anarchy". more than 10 years ago, israel destroyed a large part of the power plant located in central gaza after the kidnapping of israeli soldier gilad shalit by hamas militants. tensions and anger are now rising in the gaza strip as many are without power for more than 18 hours a day. hamas' police forces arrested dozens of people in northern gaza for their involvement in the demonstration. abu ziad sakallah owns a workshop producing household furnishings and can only work for a couple of hours every day. since then, power shortages have had an impact on almost every aspect of life in gaza. the photographer had to go to hospital and received stitches for a wound on his face. "i'm no longer able to pay the salaries of my eight workers for the time when we aren't able to work. hamas security forces, some wearing civilian clothes, then began firing live ammunition into the air and hitting civilians with batons. "we were shouting from the beginning, 'peaceful, peaceful, we need electricity'," he added. the foreign press had been told by hamas not to cover the event. "all responsible authorities must co-operate to resolve the electricity crisis immediately," he added. it's not enough to meet his deadlines for orders received. "thank god i am still alive!
"plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis," said study co-author andrás zlinszky, a researcher at the centre for ecological research at the hungarian academy of sciences. but "the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right]," the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on feb. 29, 2016, in the journal frontiers in plant science. most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said. the tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said. credit: eetu puttonen "our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches," study lead author eetu puttonen, a researcher at the finnish geospatial research institute, said in a statement. the silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found. the famed botanist carl linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist charles darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep. in the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (betula pendula) at night. the finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said. the researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. it depends on how you define "sleep," but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said. "this will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate," puttonen said. trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. it's unclear if the sun "woke up" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. "the changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet]." the finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. the laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. one tree was in finland and the other in austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in september. this provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said. this was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. after a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep? do trees sleep at night? [what is the oldest tree in the world?] however, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. [how tall can trees grow?]

the body-camera war has also included skirmishes in new york city, where vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by taser. in a statement to fast company in response to taser's new lawsuits, john collins, a vievu spokesman, said the company "believes in its cameras and technology, and looks forward to a full discovery process in which the public can see taser's underhanded tactics in full view." the suits come two weeks after vievu sued taser on the claim that the company had illegally lobbied officials in the city of phoenix to abandon a $3.6 million camera contract that vievu had recently won. because of brexit, this city is now likely to become europe’s startup capital this week, taser filed a pair of lawsuits claiming that the body cameras of competitor vievu are defective. as ceo and cofounder rick smith explained to me, the technology vision is much bigger than hardware: the coming generation of cameras will be bolstered by live-streaming, object and face recognition, and artificial intelligence. taser, the market leader, has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its cameras are simply superior to its rivals. and as it develops its software and cloud storage ecosystem for video, the company is also determined to be known as an innovator. the complaints allege that its upstart rival's cameras can lose about 5 frames per minute.

why you can't eat the best chocolate crinkles in manila (spot.ph) for those of us who don’t work there, attending a conference or a meeting at the asian development bank (adb) in ortigas requires an appointment in the system, a photo id taken on the spot, and a bout with two x-ray machines. they’re the best i’ve had in manila because unlike others, they’re well-balanced—the sweetness is just right and isn’t overwhelming, thanks to the good chocolate worked skillfully by the bakers, and the delicate touch taken with the confectioner’s sugar. but the bank’s real treasures aren’t in some vault, they’re in plain sight—the adb canteen offers scrumptious meals from several asian cuisines at affordable prices, as well as a bakery that serves up all kinds of breads, pies, and pastries. so if your work brings you to adb, share the opportunity presented with a lucky few and grab as many as you can (which is strictly limited to 20 per person—i guess crinkle hoarding is a thing!). while the bibimbap, tempura bento, and walnut pie might all be worth breaking and entering for, the real crown jewels of the adb canteen are the chocolate crinkles baked in-house daily. while you’re at it, pick up some brewed coffee at just p11 (bring your own tumbler or shell out p10 for a paper cup!) for the price, these crinkles are huge—each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. in fact, these crinkles are so decadent, i have trouble finishing more than one at a time. pop it in your mouth and you’ll find that the dark, bittersweet chocolate is as rich and rewarding as it looks. the surface, lightly dusted with confectioner’s sugar, just barely holds the structure together, and provides a subtle, cookie-like textural contrast to the chewy interiors. i love that it’s really more like a half-baked, dollar pancake-shaped brownie than your typical small, dry, boring convenience store crinkle. time your appointment just right and fall in line for the chocolate crinkles (p14/piece). there’s no doubt that the bakers don’t scrimp on the good stuff. the undercover eater works with food on a daily basis and hunts for hidden gems in his spare time. for this voracious and, dare we say, professional foodie, eating is more than a necessity—it's a vocation. i'd go through adb's airport-level security just to have it over and over again. and take your double handful of happiness out to a bench in the courtyard. and just like clockwork, a queue forms every day at mid-afternoon for these hockey pucks from heaven. they've become a legend on their own, and out of reach. you hear about them—the cookies in that really strict building. pull a crinkle apart—it’s very dense, and very moist. contact him at undercovereater.spotdotph@gmail.com.
alina gonzalez, who wrote " how i learned to fall asleep in under 1 minute " for byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding. when gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly. the 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. how to do the "4-7-8′′ exercise dr. weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the "4-7-8 exercise." the seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs. when weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the "performance killer" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot. according to an american psychological association study titled stress in america , more than 50 percent of millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. these are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the "milliennial generation," which is also sometimes referred to as generation y. this trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere. by simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation." many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night. although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. from harvard university in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of eastern wellness methodologies. these are, in short, all individual components of the body’s intrinsic and universally acknowledged "fight-or-flight" response. in a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. here is how you do the exercise: place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. it is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath. you must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. stress is widely recognized as the body’s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. the four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. the correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in american society. hold your breath for a mental count of seven. repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions. that being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of western medicine. on his website , dr. weil writes: "breathing strongly

a 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the national collegiate athletic association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. peggy sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the university of pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. while members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of president bill clinton, the new york times reports: mr. starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by mr. clinton. now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them. an analysis of national football league players by benjamin morris at fivethirtyeight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket. consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to "use force" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions. literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: one recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes. (photo: ron jenkins/getty images) last week, kenneth w. starr was stripped of his title as president of baylor university after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. college athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports — football and hockey, for example — violent by design. but are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they’re the ones accused of committing the crime? since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. the recent investigation into baylor, for example, concluded that university officials "created a cultural perception that football was above the rules." even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 philadelphia daily news article. a string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. the recent investigation into baylor concluded that university officials "created a cultural perception that football was above the rules." finley told wisconsin public radio that players of "power and performance sports" — football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball — commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. we can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. while no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. in the last two years alone, players from the university of tennessee-knoxville, florida state university, and the university of oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. still, the recent investigation at baylor found that the university’s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally. there is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to laura finley, a sociologist at barry university. more than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the department of education’s office of civil rights for sexual violence allegations. anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. and the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. an investigation found that baylor university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players. (one 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) football head coach art briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. one factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. by kate wheeling then-baylor head coach art briles looks on from the sidelines. are student athletes more likely to commit sexual assault? the relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. in other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression. without better data, it’s hard to say anything definitive on the matter.
it's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you’re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet. but in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.' even those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length, and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard, says fisch. that’s usually because they’re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. so if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners, says fisch. "you can only maximize your size to what you’re capable of achieving," dr. harry fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at weill cornell medical college and author of the new naked, tells buzzfeed life. it’s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. "if you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less," says fisch. yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. and if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. it's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all). first, let's talk about all those creams, pills, treatments, and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer, stronger boner. but you’ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don’t care either way. we’re not pointing any fingers here, but apparently lots of people are turning to google with questions about penis sizes. many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. so if you’re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. so the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system. when you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. "whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can’t get it bigger than that," says fisch. the average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says fisch. the size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure. here’s how to actually make your penis bigger just, you know, in case you're wondering. so don’t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches. now, let’s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis. "what’s good for the heart is good for the penis," says fisch. so we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this. according to a recent analysis of google data by economist seth stephens-davidowitz, the top penis-related search was "how to make my penis bigger." at buzzfeed health, we're all about helping you achieve your goals. while they won’t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. first of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. all that being said, you really shouldn’t worry so much about your size anyway. bottom line: you can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's ok. if you're not sure where to start, check out our clean eating challenge and our 28-day get fit challenge for some inspiration. then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be. definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription. the way you can do it is by losing weight." don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's viagra rx. and ok, yes, there are some pills you can take. "you can increase the size of your penis — visually. obviously erectile dysfunction meds like viagra and cialis are the most common. "there’s no actual scientific study that they rely on." another way to look bigger: trim your pubic hair. "here’s the thing," says fisch. "however, a lot of men don’t meet their potential." cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. chances are, you're actually pretty close to average. again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. they... probably won't work. this is not a trap. seriously.
but the most likely result of not voting for trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under hillary clinton’s supreme court, thousands of christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation’s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked isis, and millions of jews in israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. to my friends who tell me they won’t vote for trump because there is a chance he won’t govern at all like he promises, i reply that all of american presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen. in 2014, the supreme court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed "in jesus’ name" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (town of greece v. galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court. paul did not encourage us to pray that god would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life: "i urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way." the unprotected trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what wall street journal writer peggy noonan calls "the unprotected" in america -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. and now california’s equity in higher education act (sb 1146), which recently passed the california state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student’s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. in addition, the court could find an absolute "right to abortion" in the equal protection clause of the constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions. in the history of american politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. liberal democrats are now within one supreme court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the supreme court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one supreme court decision after another. a good candidate with flaws i do not think that voting for donald trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. executive orders and bathrooms trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by president obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of americans. why voting for donald trump is a morally good choice some of my christian friends tell me they can’t in good conscience vote for donald trump because, when faced with a choice between "the lesser of two evils," the morally right thing is to choose neither one. hobby lobby won its 2014 supreme court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, ginsburg, breyer, sotomayor, and kagan, are still on the court). on june 28, 2016, the supreme court refused to hear the stormans’ appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by justice alito (joined by roberts and thomas): "at issue are washington state regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in lemon v. kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the first amendment and ruled that a government action "must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion" (note: not a specific denomination but "religion" in general). they realize that trump didn’t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock. such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in god in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. health care trump will work to repeal obamacare, which is ruining the nation’s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced "cadillac" insurance plans. if trump would appoint a replacement for scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other supreme court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the supreme court. it would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many christian lobbying groups known as "family policy councils" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty. when i look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that i must vote for donald trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the united states of america. a tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 supreme court decision in arizona christian school tuition organization v. winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. freedom for christian influence in politics significantly, trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 johnson amendment to the irs code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. even if clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the court. they may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that america would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say "merry christmas," or that boys are different from girls, or that islamic terrorists are islamic terrorists. i am writing this article because i doubt that many "i can’t vote for trump" christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from hillary clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a trump presidency would be. and some churches in iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their "gender identity" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all. in addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that i call "reductionism" – the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. therefore i take seriously the prophet jeremiah’s exhortation to the jewish people living in exile in babylon: "seek the welfare of the city where i have sent you into exile, and pray to the lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare" (jeremiah 29:7). these incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal supreme court resulting from hillary clinton’s election, christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. if this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for trump, this action will directly help hillary clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. a lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a "dream list" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. if that case is overturned, it would force hobby lobby out of business, because the green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, i suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. my reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. it instantly nullified all the work that thousands of christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. campus ministries like cru and intervarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 supreme court decision cls v. martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the christian legal society from the campus of hastings college of law in san francisco. but the main reason i call him "a good candidate with flaws" is that i think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation. every action i take, i will ask myself: does this make life better for young americans in baltimore, chicago, detroit, ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in america? in my judgment, christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because obama’s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. the court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. i believe that character does matter, but i think trump’s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent’s character. in short, a trump-appointed supreme court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to christians. such a supreme court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench. his many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-semitic or misogynistic – i think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. it would also protect freedom of conscience for christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. with regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to christian schools. the nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. therefore the question that christians should ask is this: can i in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like hillary clinton win the presidency? the supreme court with trump as president trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the supreme court. abortion on abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in gonzalez v. carhart, 2007). there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the state . china and russia trump will not let china and russia and iran push us around anymore, as obama has done, with hillary clinton’s support when she was secretary of state. so a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. trump said in his acceptance speech, "every day i wake up determined to deliver for the people i have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . by contrast, clinton will bow to the teachers’ unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth. in this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both trump and clinton will do what they have promised to do. this year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat hillary clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. the prophet obadiah rebuked the people of the edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the babylonians conquered jerusalem: "on the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . we should rather work to prevent such oppression of christians, just as jesus taught us to pray, "lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (matthew 6:13). florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections. religious liberty a conservative court would vigorously uphold the first amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for christian colleges, christian ministries, and churches. christian colleges would likely be found guilty of "discrimination" if they required adherence to the bible’s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary christian beliefs. fire chief kelvin cochran in atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the bible’s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. last year boston urologist paul church, a harvard medical school faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at beth israel deaconess medical center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity. another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in european countries is any indicator. the most likely result of voting for trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation. therefore i feel the force of the words of james: "whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin" (james 4:17). minorities two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again trump’s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. they will likely now be put out of business by the washington state pharmacy board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. by way of modern application, i think christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will "seek the welfare" of the united states. trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the federalist society, the organization that promotes the "original meaning" view so strongly exemplified by justice scalia before his death. and you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the american system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny. this would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the supreme court even without justice kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them. a president clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the supreme court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. if this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern." israel trump has promised to vigorously defend and support israel, while clinton will most likely continue the obama administration’s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of israel. pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with congress. while i disagree with trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, trump will likely do much good for the nation. judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph. we lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal supreme court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage. she could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. the supreme court with clinton as president hillary clinton would quickly replace justice scalia with another liberal like breyer, ginsburg, sotomayor, and kagan. a conservative court would likely declare that the first amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination. and we need to keep talking with each other – because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. this event has troubling implications for christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda. we have already seen it happen with the irs targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) in this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a clinton or a trump presidency. in what follows, i will compare the results we could expect from a clinton presidency with what we could expect from a trump presidency. borders trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. we still need to respect each other and thank god that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. (italics added) christian business owners if clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many christian business owners will be targeted. therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation? clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future democratic voters. mozilla/firefox ceo brendan eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to proposition 8 in california, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. energy trump has said he will approve the keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. in this case, the most likely result is that trump will do most or all of what he has said. abortion such a court would likely overturn roe v. wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states. he continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. the case concerned a washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the stormans family, who are committed christians. in our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda. the military trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves." clinton will continue the anemic obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which isis has continued to thrive. these american citizens recognize that trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. they’re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. is withholding a vote from donald trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom? mike pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. they have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands. some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy trump-clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. but the teachings of scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. voters should not doubt the power of the supreme court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. the supreme court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the united states. but clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry. but i wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a clinton presidency. lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. criminalizing dissent another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. and he said: "nearly 4 in 10 african-american children are living in poverty, while 58% of african-american youth are not employed . it would also imply that nativity scenes without santa claus and buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at christmas time. now that trump has won the gop nomination, i think voting for trump is a morally good choice. he is a former board member of the indiana family institute, a conservative christian lobbying group in indiana. it is also possible that a conservative supreme court would eventually return control of marriage to the states. (this was already the ruling of the second circuit in the bronx household of faith case regarding new york city public schools.) trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the republican convention. we will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice." nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom. and there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them. taxes and jobs trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while clinton wants to raise them. it is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any democratic nominee would champion. under president obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. but no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. "but trump has changed his mind in the past," a politically-minded friend said to me. he has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. "but my conscience won’t let me vote for donald trump," some have told me. this would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech. clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket. churches churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal supreme court. i believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. the three conservative justices still on the supreme court expressed similar concerns just last month. (1timothy 2:1) christian schools and colleges a liberal supreme court would also impact education. groups who dare to disagree with activists’ claims about the danger of man-made global warming. seek the good of the nation should christians even try to influence elections at all? trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. these are certainly flaws, but i don’t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election. it is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting trump in overwhelming numbers. he has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. many can’t even find jobs, and others can’t find full-time jobs. sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. i do not think it is right to call him an "evil candidate." this is dangerous in light of increasing threats from china, russia, iran, and isis. some christians have even hinted to me that "persecution would be good for us." freedom of speech freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. so it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. but the bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. step-by-step, christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. in addition, i think there are several positive reasons to vote for trump. it wouldn’t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. as a professor who has taught christian ethics for 39 years, i think their analysis is incorrect. however, the supreme court is not the only issue at stake in this election. that is the basis on which we should decide how to vote. he pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. "how do you know that he will do what he has promised? many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. religious liberty the current liberal agenda often includes suppressing christian opposition to its views. trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. think of the power of the obergefell v. hodges 5-4 decision in june, 2015. a vote for trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things. the legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. the implications for other christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous. finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth. for individual taxpayers, trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for clinton it’s 45%. are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. if trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won’t be bullied. on the other hand, i think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. that is why they cheer when trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. isis and terrorism trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat isis. how can we know that trump won’t change his mind? i think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. his situation holds ominous implications for any christians who hold public sector jobs. that is why this election is not just about hillary clinton. lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for jerusalem, you were like one of them." justice ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. colleges like biola and azusa pacific could not long survive under those regulations. tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. it would restore true freedom of religion as the first amendment intended. i think rather he is a good candidate with flaws. american citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. maybe he’ll betray you and appoint a liberal supreme court justice." the apostle peter says christians are "exiles" on this earth (1 peter 1:1). in fact, it is the morally right thing to do. i did not support trump in the primary season. already christians are being pushed out of many occupations. this administration has failed america’s inner cities. but now i plan to vote for him. "but are you saying that character doesn’t matter?" he has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. i even spoke against him at a pastors’ conference in february. but hillary clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies. the results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good. they recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate. he can be vindictive when people attack him. and notice how trump has changed his mind. millions of unborn children would continue to die. it’s failed them on crime . it’s failed them on education. consider instead the most likely results. it’s failed and on jobs. this is my contribution to that discussion. he often lacks nuance in his statements. but that is not all. he is a committed evangelical christian. but this can change. we should applaud these changes. he has raised remarkable children. his choice of indiana gov. he is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. does character matter? someone might ask. (obadiah 1:11). justice kennedy is 80. justice breyer is 78. he insults people. yes, definitely. .

that appears to be warren buffett's philosophy when it comes to who should be the next head of the federal reserve -- he'd rather have current chairman ben bernanke remain in the position. the billionaire investor and philanthropist appeared on cnbc's "closing bell" thursday to weigh in on the debate over who'll be president barack obama's pick to succeed bernanke when his term expires next year. buffett's comments echo similar ones he made last october when he said he'd "get my kids out and everybody else to vote for [bernanke]" for another term. here’s who warren buffett thinks should be the next fed chairman if it ain't broke, don't fix it. "he may want to leave, but i think he's done -- since the panic of five years ago -- i think he's done a terrific job. buffett also endorsed bernanke back in 2009, in the heat of the crisis, calling him "the ideal person to be running the fed." and i think he ought to get a little bit more of a chance to play out the hand." "when you have a .400 hitter in the lineup you don't take him out," buffett said. the fed chairman himself, however, likely won't be talked into the idea of holding onto the position. obama revealed in june that bernanke had "already stayed a lot longer than he wanted." but buffett, as it turns out, is all for bernanke. current federal reserve vice chair janet yellen is the current white house front-runner, after economist larry summers dropped out last sunday.
his untitled daily show companion series will air monday-thursday at 11:30 p.m. et/pt, beginning this fall, taking over the timeslot vacated by the nightly show with larry wilmore, which was cancelled last august. his new series is in the beginning stages of development and will be produced by klepper, trevor noah and stuart miller (the daily show with jon stewart, ferrell takes the field). klepper has established himself for his mix of studio segments and field work, ranging from his multi-part series exploring the reality of being a "good guy with a gun" to his field pieces at trump rallies which have garnered millions of views. to be fair, the guy who got the gig is the very funny jordan klepper, who has been with the daily show since jon stewart's tenure, and has proven his comedic chops as the senior correspondent under trevor noah. the untitled show will "look to embrace and define the chaos of our country by channeling klepper’s steadfast attitude that institutions are to be trusted less than the lies of the mainstream media," according to comedy central's release. coming this fall comedy central has found its replacement for larry wilmore's nightly show, and it's... another white dude, because late night tv clearly doesn't have enough of those. "the choice to entrust me with the 11:30 p.m. timeslot is both incredibly humbling and deeply disturbing," said klepper in a statement. "without a doubt, it has utterly destroyed my confidence in comedy central’s decision making acumen. dear god, now i have to work with these fools."
we wanted to help users protect their identity & internet connection to eliminate the risk of any online, banking or personal information being stolen, monitored or hacked" the company saferweb seemed to deliver on this objective perfectly. experts are now calling saferweb, "a game changer for internet users" as part of the special promotion due to end , a group of engineers teamed up with innovative new software provider saferweb, to provide the latest id protection thats just gone viral. if you have a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone connected to the internet, your activities could be monitored and private information collected when you’re internet shopping or banking. using their technology will give a private tunnel between you and the internet that’s invisible to hackers or any malware, letting you browse the internet anonymously and securely. earlier this month we saw thousands of people across get their hands on the the latest online id protection from saferweb, after yet another increase in identity theft and web-history monitoring. if you live in and have a computer, tablet or smartphone connected to the internet, then this may be the most important news you read all year. one user we spoke to said, "i came across saferweb and decided to give it a go, it’s less than a cup of coffee anyways. i’ve always been anxious about who watches the sites i use and how safe my information really is and heard countless stories about people having their banking information hacked. we have however been advised that because of its unexpected popularity, availability is very limited and is now on a first come first serve basis. 1 reason not to go online if you live in the u.s. here is the simple 3 click step recommended by smarterweblife to get yourself instant protection: here is the simple 3 click step recommended by smarterweblife to get yourself instant protection: saferweb had a primary objective to eliminate this by boosting security and ensure eavesdroppers cannot make sense of your encrypted communications. even just browsing online is a risk in 2016. so, how do you protect your online identity today? literally anyone can use it and it only takes 5 minutes to set up. so how can saferweb give this away? for instance, burger king launched a similar campaign in 2013, giving away 20,000 free whoppers on facebook." this is the perfect solution to eliminate this. technical lead john mcbride, from saferweb explains; our main objective for creating the app was pretty simple. i noticed the difference right away and couldn’t be happier with results. apparently this promotional tactic is common among big companies with large marketing budgets.
the endocannabinoid system finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. sleep deprivation and obesity it has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. they found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening. according to a recent study at the university of chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. endocannabinoid 2-ag is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. erin hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite. the results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint. conducting the study the university of chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. "we know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods," hanlon said. ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food. the researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm. you'll never guess what else gives you the munchies until now you thought that your love for marijuana was the reason for your munchies, but you’ll never guess what else can actually give you the munchies. the researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. this means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it. the scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. they included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. so it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety. the results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation. after the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived? they looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. "sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner." let us know your thoughts on our social media or in the comments section below.

some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: "no vampire i’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood," browning said, according to bbc. [7 strange ways that people act like vampires] because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. according to katherine ramsland in her book "the science of vampires" (penguin putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, "requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. in very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams." of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. turns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: in 2011, a 19-year-old texas man named lyle bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. john edgar browning of georgia tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a bbc article that thousands of people across the united states drink blood for various reasons. with such a high interest in vampires these days — they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves — many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires. when confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. while iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. this condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders. this was not bedroom playacting between lovers; bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. if you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim. unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. when ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. the woman escaped and called police, and lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault. because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us. even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. [circulatory system: facts, function & diseases] the strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. benjamin radford is deputy editor of skeptical inquirer science magazine and author of six books including scientific paranormal investigation: how to solve unexplained mysteries. editor's note: this article was first published on sept. 2, 2011. but when ingested it's a very different story. but is it safe to drink blood? is it safe to drink blood? you, however, are not a vampire bat. beyond that, watch out. his web site is www.benjaminradford.com.
of course, this survey isn’t a blanket statement about any particular generation or couple, and every individual and couple has their own challenges to face, but it is still awesome to see something positive being said about the millennial age group. it’s hard to keep the romance alive if you’re feeling stressed out about money and you’re afraid of talking to your partner about something that affects the both of you so closely. though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations. the study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships. among this group, couples were found to be much happier on average than the other demographics, with 49% of the millennial couples saying that they’re "extremely happy" with their "soulmate." turns out, according to the second annual td bank love and money study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners. this is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense. *) but this new study shows that millennial couples are actually much better at a certain relationship skill than other generations. if you're a millennial couple, chances are you flat-out rock at this nbc a lot of people give millennials flack (*cough cough, baby boomers! the survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters. whether we like it or not, money affects our everyday lives, from where we live to what we eat. the fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer. most of the couples classified themselves as "married" or "committed." because, let’s face it, we’re pretty great. millennials were classified as participants who were 18-34 years old. we’re good at something! giphy that’s right! awww!
the side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as "moon face." exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you’ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine. that seemed curious, but i was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that i ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. phil ringo, 74, of haverford, pa., couldn’t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill. "i thought i’d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man," he said. "how many women of caucasian origin, who are older, think they’re just aging and can’t do everything they used to — when they actually have this disease?" although diagnosing pmr can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with pmr. such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to marcy o’koon moss, director of consumer health for the arthritis foundation, which counts pmr among more than 100 diseases it focuses on. with the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, america’s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of pmr. eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for kermath’s doctor, who started her on prednisone. as i face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, i hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest x-ray and a cat scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. most doctors suspecting pmr order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the esr test, and another for crp, or c-reactive protein. given my age — 73 — my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body — sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. biologics — drugs made from living organisms — hold promise because some can "inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam," the arthritis foundation’s o’koon moss said. and when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation’s top diagnostic clinics, "they basically said, ‘you’re an old guy.’ " ringo said. " for a pmr patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. most patients who take prednisone for pmr will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects. ‘ just get used to it.’ " he was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist. "grandchildren were saying, ‘what’s wrong with papa?’ " unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. leslie kermath, 70, of whitefish, mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that pmr was causing her pain, stiffness and fever. i was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when i realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press. i felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. the culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or pmr, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body’s joints. "and there are other conditions that mimic pmr," such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer. later she had another cat scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. "there are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have fda approval for that. the hope is that i can be steroid-free — a sign of a cure — sometime in 2017. why and how pmr strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. in the healthy body, those sacs — some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar — keep our joints moving smoothly. pmr patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of gca: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision. instead, i’d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. the diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. when i finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected pmr. but as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work. in most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. "a definitive test does not exist for pmr," said rheumatologist rebecca manno, a johns hopkins school of medicine faculty member and researcher. "i’d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in." any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. the afflicted are more often of northern european extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work. "treating pmr is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice," said my doctor, joseph p. laukaitis. getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task. much of today’s research into pmr and gca looks for alternatives to prednisone. giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. the rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away. after eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control. doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease. the first hint of trouble came just a week after i had knee replacement surgery. my rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. but undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system. and in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease. yet it strikes many older americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime — rowing. it had kept me in shape for years, and i was missing early mornings on the potomac. many people stricken with pmr confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. pmr also impedes the bone marrow’s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia. i felt as if i’d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. but when inflamed by pmr, they cause pain and stiffness. until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides. and they may be effective for pmr," manno said. the important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. months later, i still hadn’t picked up an oar. fortunately, pmr responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. the cells involved signal each other and communicate," she said. "in my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover." "it’s not one thing that happens. but in fact, prednisone is "wonderful, wicked" in manno’s words. said kermath, who is an avid hiker. a lyme disease test came back negative. again, prednisone is the treatment. actually pmr is famously tricky to diagnose. so the diagnostic process can be torturous. "it’s like interrupting a chain reaction." untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. neither had i. never heard of it?
here’s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the cubs won game 7: top of 1st: fowler crushes one corey kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single world series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when dexter fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the indians fans at cleveland’s progressive field. bottom of 10th: indians get a run, but needed two with one out left in the game, the indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the cubs ended a world series drought that had been going since 1908. cleveland brought in trevor bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out jason heyward and getting javier baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.the indians now have three outs to get back into the game. that brought up dexter fowler, who had been one of the cubs’ better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before francisco lindor chased it down behind second base and threw fowler out at first. kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of anthony rizzo’s reach, which resulted in francisco lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. brought in for a four-out save, chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to brandon guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as guyer drove the ball to left–center for a double, bringing in a run. top of 6th: ross makes up for mistakes david ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed chicago’s lead back to 6-3. victor mather: it’s been a tough series for napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. the yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. bottom of 4th: hendricks works well with a lead kyle hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from joe maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring jose ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. david waldstein: the cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a national league team at sea level (red sox had 878 runs, the rockies 845). bottom of 7th: lester gets job done coco crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then jon lester ran the count full against roberto perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. he somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing miller’s "unhittable" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when anthony rizzo sliced a single to right. michael martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but shaw took care of javier baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. top of 3rd: schwarber runs cubs out of inning javier baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. bottom of 5th: lester and ross open door for indians the move to bring in jon lester as a reliever had major implications for the cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, david ross. david ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the cubs, just hit his first world series home run. schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with ben zobrist at the plate, but kluber was able to get zobrist to pop out to end the inning. albert almora came in as a pinch-runner for schwarber and the move paid off when kris bryant hit a deep flyout to center and almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second. the indians had the shift on, and francisco lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single. terrible inning by ross, who made the error to allow kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of ross’s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored. addison russell was the offensive star of game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but corey kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. a day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a game 7 appearance, aroldis chapman proved to be human by giving up chicago’s three-run lead in just two batters. shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to addison russell, and with the bases loaded, miguel montero laced a single into left that drove in chicago’s eighth run of the game. jon lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after jose ramirez hit a ball up the middle that addison russell couldn’t quite handle. francisco lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but javier baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed lindor to reach safely. it looked like chicago could do even more damage when ben zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but rajai davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. bryant, knowing that rajai davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from roberto perez. leadoff man carlos santana crushed a liner to right on kyle hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at jason heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. it came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. the versatile veteran who won a world series with kansas city last year made him pay for it by driving in almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the cubs. brandon guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for lonnie chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but rajai davis grounded out to strand him at first. bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against corey kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. david waldstein: when fowler hit that home run, i almost thought for a moment that rajai davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. the cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in chris coghlan as a pinch-runner for ross, but he was erased on a force-out when jason heyward grounded to second base. for the cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever. kluber looked like he had contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over davis’s head. that brought up jose ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating addison russell’s throw to first base that anthony rizzo made a great stretch on. that brought kyle schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against andrew miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting schwarber to fly out to left. dexter fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from corey kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. top of 5th: baez ends kluber’s night the cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of corey kluber and andrew miller. chicago allowed guyer to advance to second base without a throw and davis delivered again with a single that drove guyer in and closed the gap to one run. but schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by lonnie chisenhall to end the inning. allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from miller by striking out kris bryant, as fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play. at least the cleveland cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance wednesday at progressive field, broke cleveland’s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the n.b.a. top of 4th: cubs back on top a shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by kris bryant put the cubs back in the lead. top of 8th: allen shuts down cubs a dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but anthony rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. top of 9th: cubs’ squeeze doesn’t work with new life breathed into the cleveland indians, and rain starting to fall, cody allen walked the leadoff batter, david ross, on five pitches. he retired lonnie chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got rajai davis to fly to right to end the inning. with their closer gone, the cubs called on carl edwards jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. it is their third title in the world series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of american sports. back in chicago, where fans in the north side of chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days. david waldstein: lonnie chisenhall has had an adventurous world series, but he has a great arm and schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. but a double and a two-run home run by the indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning. david waldstein: lester (and to a lesser degree, ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the cubs’ madison bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned cubs moment. he fired kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. javier baez took a hard cut at kluber’s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace’s night. top of 10th: rain delay, then cubs pounce the cubs are back in the lead thanks to ben zobrist, miguel montero, and a couple questional intentional walks. jason heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and javier baez struck out to end the inning. with rajai davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, cubs pitching coach chris bosio visited the mound. bottom of 3rd: indians get aggressive the indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. the cubs’ designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game. coco crisp piled on with a single but yan gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning. dexter fowler was the first batter to face miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. the shenanigans in the outfield in game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, tyler naquin, and that is why he is on the bench. bottom of 2nd: hendricks helps himself the indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it. victor mather: hendricks last pitched in game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. some may have wanted the indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on hendricks, but francona elected to draw even. prior to joining the cubs, epstein was the general manager of the boston red sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first world series in 86 years. kris bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and anthony rizzo followed him by flying out to center. terry francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with miller and start what could be a long night for the indians’ bullpen. he got a soft grounder to second from coco crisp for the first out, and struck out roberto perez for out two. the indians were very sloppy in game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather. coco crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. joe maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for michael montgomery with michael martinez due up. heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from yan gomes. even baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable kluber. he is the cubs’ top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history’s long reach. kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for. with the ball coming at him fairly slowly, addison russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as ramirez reached first. it looked like it could get far worse for the cubs, but kyle hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners. rizzo slid in under lindor’s feet, but was ruled out even though lindor’s foot may not have been on the bag. anthony rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up ben zobrist with two runners on and no outs. how the chicago cubs won game 7 but 2016 was the 108th year after their last title, and a baseball is sewn together with 108 stitches. top of 7th: cubs chase miller, but fail to score dexter fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. the indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth. but with that that, miller’s day was over, with terry francona replacing him with the team’s closer, cody allen. hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from mike napoli to end the inning. the indians have not won the world series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity. but once it let up, the cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. bottom of 1st: indians can’t match cubs’ start the indians were not able to match the cubs’ strong start to the game. addison russell flipped to javier baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play. carlos santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing crisp home and tying the game. aroldis chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. bottom of 6th: indians come up short mike napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. it was so important for the indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. because hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the cubs hold on. kyle hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though jon lester was ready in chicago’s bullpen. with two outs, kyle schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. the ending was complicated because aroldis chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. david waldstein: the indians are squaring up on hendricks, so cubs manager joe maddon instructed jon lester to start warming up. yes, you will see a lot of yankees fans in tampa in may, but this is game 7 of the world series. addison russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to rajai davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the indians had roberto perez bunt crisp over to third. andrew miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs. david waldstein: terry francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. victor mather: if this were the last time the cubs won the world series, the game would be over. that brought up addison russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out jason kipnis to end the inning. the play was ruled a single rather than an error, as russell likely did not have a play. hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning. he hit a grounder to first that mike napoli fielded and threw to francisco lindor who was covering second. lonnie chisenhall singled, but rajai davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering davis’s speed. roberto perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. tyler naquin came in as a pinch-runner for perez before carlos santana hit a come-backer to lester. that really messed up the inning because chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out. on wednesday night the cubs beat the cleveland indians, 8-7, in a game 7 for the ages. kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at progressive field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. double and with a 3-1 lead, chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game. but francisco lindor flied out to left and mike napoli lined out to third to end the threat. the left-hander took care of business, retiring martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save. miller, who the indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches. his rookie season was a key part of the cubs’ fine year; now he adds a big world series r.b.i. but hendricks walked carlos santana and his day was done, with lester being summoned to face jason kipnis. he got carlos santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with jason kipnis. perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the indians’ pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of schwarber lengthening the lineup. bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and rizzo reached second after the throw. ben zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and miguel montero followed up with an r.b.i. because of two miscues by ross, the indians scored two runs, cutting chicago’s lead in half. jose ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of kyle hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the indians. the cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. but kyle schwarber gave miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play. willson contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that lonnie chisenhall tracked down with little effort. terrific, aggressive base running by jason kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. lester was able to strike out lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting. he threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs. with one run in, jason kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. making it even more sweet was that the cubs trailed in the series by three games to one. red sox and cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and epstein has given closure to both. it was the first leadoff home run ever in game 7 of a world series. top of 2nd: kluber settles in kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. as you might expect, with an indians world series on the line, the crowd is sparse in akron. it was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on santana at second was overturned. kris bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of miller. victor mather: wilson contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the cubs’ worst series performer. bottom of 9th: chapman shuts down indians in 9th this game is headed to extra innings. david waldstein: kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. after fowler’s blast, kyle schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. with that victory — yes, the following words are really true — the chicago cubs won the world series. upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. david waldstein: great play by the icy-veined kyle hendricks to pick off jose ramirez off first. the 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out mike napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. he woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the tv remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. then ben zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by cody allen’s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. i have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. but this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. the decisive game 5 of that series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. but everyone knows hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. the defensive miscue set cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. the cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. one of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. the tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. he never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. he got jose ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. he also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. now it’s up the the indians hitters to get him back even. kluber ended the bleeding by retiring jason heyward on a pop-out to shortstop. while miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. in the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent cubs fans. the top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. ramirez, however, underestimated hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first. after a brief rain delay, the game resumed with kyle schwarber facing off against bryan shaw. in cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. with first base empty, shaw intentionally walked anthony rizzo to get to zobrist. if it is not 50-50 between cubs and indians fans, then it is 40-60. but he comes through to give the cubs the 3-1 lead. but it just couldn’t come easy, couldn’t be won without extra drama. that brought up brandon guyer, and edwards walked him on five pitches. but crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs. the meat of the indians’ order comes up at least two more times. the cubs seem to be rolling ever since game 5. jason kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. david waldstein: now the indians are making the miscues. now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. but it was cubs fans celebrating the home run. they are nine outs away from doing it again. zobrist scored and contreras got into second base easily. francisco lindor flied out to right, ending the inning. no game in the series lasted more than 2:10. david waldstein: that was a great inning by hendricks. allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs. single to give the cubs the insurance run they needed. david waldstein: i promise, were not making all this up. orval overall outdueled wild bill donovan, and the cubs won the world series. victor mather: maybe you aren’t a baseball fan. jason heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop. well, akron and toledo are involved in some exciting

once you’re at a stop and have caught all the new pokémon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new pokéstop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it. 3: leave your phone on, but on silent and hidden one big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you’re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). you can tap on further away gyms and pokéstops to see where they are before they’re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you’d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving. it’s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don’t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. you can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car’s interior, but don’t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic. how to play pokémon go in your car without mowing down trees or people illustration credit: sam woolley let’s get this out of the way: pokémon go is meant for walking. so, if you must catch ‘em all in a car, there are some things that can be done to mitigate the risk of crashing into police, being charged with vehicular manslaughter or just being bad at the game. so, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands—or laps on a race track—to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan. you can eat a cheeseburger with your knee as you put on make-up with your elbow and steer the car with your chin, and you’ve done it before. you can’t easily spin around in the driver’s seat if a pokémon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway. i will say that my fear of becoming that guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing pokémon go has made me a less distracted driver. yes, there’s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that ar feature on to put pokémon on a backdrop of whatever’s in front of you. 2: scope out your next pokéstop before going there the great thing about the pokémon go interface is that it gives you a map. once you have your next pokéstop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. while i couldn’t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph—which sounds about right. i’m out of my car anyway and it’s a place i don’t mind hanging out for a little while. then you’ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of magikarp. if you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it. because you have to drive safely, we don’t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla... how to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a porsche 918 spyder. if you’re playing around cars, make sure they’re going to stay parked for a while. i know there’s at least one or two of you out there who are thinking, "ha! or, if you have a manual transmission, don’t even think about playing until you’ve yanked the parking brake. there are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars. turns out, there’s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. you would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road. we’ve seen driving players hit trees, and at least two have even hit cop cars—one in baltimore and another in montréal. i simply don’t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel. even then, i felt dumb when i didn’t move up immediately because there was a poliwag in sight. this will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who’s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes. problem is, you’re then focusing on catching the pokémon instead of the background of reality. it’s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy pokémon. so, keep it in park if you’re going to do anything in the game. after my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, i wondered what was up. if you’re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. one of many landmarks you’ll find as pokéstops in the game. find a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car’s navigation unit. that’s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. but for those tempted to play the game while driving, it’s proven extremely dangerous. fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting pokémon. rather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would. if you know you’ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. with the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. it’s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. pick pokéstops that coincide with other errands you have to do. sponsored i tried catching pokémon while parked in a drive-thru. if you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk. park somewhere where you’ll stay parked to catch pokémon. but where i live, it’s also upwards of 100 degrees outside right now. 4: get out and walk around anyway i’m always looking for shortcuts. when you park, do so in a safe and legal location. let me say this again for good measure: don’t. the little suckers move around in ar mode, too! my usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. pokémon go requires your full attention. parked to figure out my next move. the app was one step ahead of that idea. this is america; that’s for suckers. your mortal rules can not apply to me." driving also requires your full attention. http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla... out of sight, out of mind. here are some rules to follow. 1: don’t don’t! see your city’s landmarks. that’s the problem. just don’t. simply put: "p" means "play." then drive there! driving is great. i am a multitasking god! rule no. that’s convenient! and besides, walking? 12! nope. inside petrol lounge, austin.
here are a few other secret features hidden in products: a chinese takeout dish folds out to a nice little plate: some pens have a hole in the cap so you can breathe if swallowed: a soda can has a built in straw-holder: a soda can has a built in straw-holder: i’ll admit it, i didn’t until i recently read about this novel use for the plastic lids of starbucks cups, like the kind they use for iced coffee. did you realize the standard starbucks lid was designed to be used as a drink coaster? of course, it should be noted that this applies to other plastic cups beside starbucks. however, i’m not part of the starbucks cult fan base, as i only visit there at christmas time for their beyond-belief-fantastic hot chocolate. so this is sort of a hidden design feature, right? it’s not the only product that has an added benefit hiding in plain sight. did you know the lids from plastic cups were made to do this? so check it out. (the whipped cream is the key.) pop ‘er off and there you go. yep!
if adopting isn’t ideal for you, fostering a pet is also a great way to make a difference by providing a homeless pet with a loving environment until they are able to be adopted out. the worst gift to give this christmas it’s safe to say we can all get swept up in a frenzy of what would make the perfect christmas gift for our loved ones. if you want to buy someone a pet this christmas (fluffy, feathered or in between) make sure you have a conversation with your loved one first. some people simply do not have the means to keep a pet, the time to train them...or unfortunately they are genuinely not wanted at all. unfortunately, the choice to give an animal as a surprise present during the silly season can sometimes be a shotgun decision...and the gift isn’t always so well received. if this article has inspired you to make a difference, there’s a number of things you can do to help out! it gives them a lifetime of companionship, and it gives a pet the chance to go to a loving home. bringing a new life into someone else’s is a huge commitment, and it needs to be a decision that is made by all people involved. numbers at shelters also swell with older animals being dumped as owners are unable to find alternate homes or kennels over the holidays. as a result, many people will take their pet to the rspca or local animal shelter to surrender it. these animals are so eager to love and you can feel great knowing you have saved them from an uncertain future. this ensures that you have all the facts beforehand, and you can take the journey together from the very first step. you can get started by creating a fundraising page or donating to your local rspca or shelter this holiday break. take action: why not consider adopting a pet from your local rspca or animal shelter? buying a pet as for someone you care about is a wonderful idea over the holidays. the statistics are tragic as often the animals will have to be put down. in recent years, the statistics stand at three pets being abandoned every hour over the christmas period. the rspca is annually inundated with unwanted gifted pets from boxing day onwards. make a contribution: spread some christmas cheer around. spread some christmas cheer around.

that's because scarlett johansson -- who co-stars with joaquin phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic academy award nomination for best supporting actress. "johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. ellison tweeted this in response to hammond's post on sunday: @nikkifinke @deadline scarlett is eligible, deserves the recognition, and we are going to campaign for her — megan ellison (@meganeellison) october 13, 2013 "her" is out in theaters on dec. 18. jonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out johansson's voice work as exceptional. detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as samantha, both here on earth and up there in the cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience," wrote variety critic scott foundas. scarlett johansson could make oscar history spike jonze's "her" made its world premiere at the new york film festival on saturday night, and the warner bros. release could factor into the oscar race like no other film ever before. as deadline.com's pete hammond pointed out, non-traditional "flesh-and-blood" acting roles -- like andy serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as gollum in the "lord of the rings" films -- are normally ignored by academy awards voters. for what it's worth, warner bros. and "her" producer megan ellison are planning a full-court press for johansson's awards campaign. removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation. "it's johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: she creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. with regard to johansson's oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. (huffpost entertainment was in the tank for johansson as well.) more on the film can be found here. 'her' photos 'her' photos 'her' photos it's incredibly appealing," echoed hitfix critic drew mcweeny.
all blue-eyed people have this one thing in common every blue-eyed person on the planet is descended from a single european who lived around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and who first developed a specific mutation that accounts for the now widespread iris coloration. originally, all humans had brown eyes, although genetic variation relating to a gene called oca2 resulted in changes to the amount of pigment produced by different individuals, resulting in the emergence of different shades of brown. it is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from africa to europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early european. the fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the oca2 gene, but without success. this alteration switches off oca2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. more recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called herc2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. to date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern spain. naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color.

bring it on.so, on the morning of may 18, i took one last selfie as a brunette, grabbed a coffee, and headed over to hairstory for my transformation. i also did it because i was sick of my single status dictating the way i looked.once i booked the appointment, though, the panic set in. 6, 2016.last month, i made the decision to go blond as a way to untether my identity from my hair. at the last minute, i was ushered into the warm and welcoming hands of the team over at hairstory studio in new york city — specifically colorist and mega-babe roxie darling roxie put me at ease. what no one tells you about going platinum (blonde) this story was originally published on jun. i'll be answering them in the comments and in an upcoming story. this story was originally published on jun. ahead, see what the experience of going blond was like. these fears were further heightened when my original colorist wasn't available for the double-process. "it will change your life because you will be received so much differently," she says. what if i turned into a hideously ugly beast? and if you have any questions, please leave them below! basically, i was about to become daenerys targaryen. did i make the right decision? "people's eyes are naturally drawn to light, and naturally drawn away from darkness." would my hair fall out?
another theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the new york herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing "the stretch" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). one popular story dates back to the days of president william howard taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. the fascinating tradition that sets baseball apart there are several competing theories as to why, in the middle of the seventh inning, every baseball game comes to a stop so everyone can stretch, sing a really old song and take a breather. la russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay. (photo by mark rucker/transcendental graphics, getty images) the camaraderie dave ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of "beyond the cheers," believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything. but for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique. relive the longest game in baseball history: email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @schultz_report. (ap) the tradition "the seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history," tony la russa, the three-time world series-winning manager, told the huffington post. the lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. president william howard taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in washington in april of 1910. ichiro suzuki, the new york yankees outfielder and future hall of famer, told the huffington post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties. email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @schultz_report. and during those nearly three hours, actual baseball happens for only 18 minutes -- including balls in play and wild pitches -- according to a study by the wall street journal. according to mlb.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. the music aside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. it was written by jack norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films. the 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. and the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. this past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes. the mysterious origins the origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. tony la russa: "the seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history." during the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies. naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw taft stand, they followed suit. also, be sure and catch my nbc sports radio show, kup and schultz, which airs sunday mornings from 9-12 et, right here. "it's actually taken on its own life, depending on the team," ferguson told huffpost. "the players look at it as a break from the game itself. here are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment. during the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof. and it's appreciated by the fans." the relief baseball is physically and mentally grueling.
new research was presented at the 249th national meeting & exposition of the american chemical society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent. our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. in other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body. the crazy cooking hack that slashes the calories in rice by half whether you think rice is a friend or foe to your diet, there's one thing we can all agree on: it's delicious. adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. no word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool—they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more. if you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. the researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch—one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. for now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free. (if you don't agree, i'm sorry, but i don't understand you.) bonus: you don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. translation: same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body. this is where the coconut oil comes in. reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found. like i said: seriously cool.
sure, it’s kind of gross when cats bring dead animals into the house, but they do it because they consider you family – and they’re trying to teach you how to catch your own prey. it may be annoying sometimes, but when your cat follows you absolutely everywhere from room to room, it’s just a sign that they like you and want to be where you are. cats do the same when they’re grooming their kittens, so it’s much more likely that they think of you with the same affection. when cats rub their head against you, they’re marking you as one of their own with the concentrated scent glands in their cheeks and head. if you can get your cat purring, it means that they’re very happy with you and with what you’re doing. there are many theories about why cats knead their paws into you, but many researchers agree that they’re trying to return the affection that you’re showing them. cats aren’t quite as expressive as dogs when it comes to letting their owners know how they feel about them. much like with head-butting, cats will run between your legs to mark you with their scent. so if they roll over and present their belly to you, it’s a sign of unwavering trust. the truth is that cats feel just as much affection for their humans as their canine counterparts. but more than that, a steady, soft gaze means that they feel safe and comfortable with you. if you ever see your cat doing this, they’re trying to tell you something very important. they’re just kind of shy, awkward, and mysterious when it comes to expressing affection. a cat’s unending stare can be a little bit disconcerting, but don’t fret. they just say "i love you" a little differently... and often in the strangest ways possible. and if they’re feeling really affectionate, they’ll wrap it around you. the higher they carry it, the more content and happy they are. cats nip and nibble at us all the time, but it’s far from an aggressive gesture. still, that doesn’t mean they don’t love you. they just don’t know that it actually hurts. your cat’s tail is a strong indicator of their mood. first of all, they’re not really staring. like most creatures, cats don’t like to make themselves vulnerable. just like i was in high school. their eyes are evolved to blink less frequently than ours. cats aren’t really evil. congratulations, you’re family. 4. see? 3. 6. 2. 7. 8. 1. 9. 10. 5.

filling a void the transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at fort knox has two stages, according to retired col. walter herd, the director of the army’s transition assistance program: preparation for a career outside the army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world. "what was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- i remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at fort irwin so it doesn’t happen somewhere else," pickett said. retired col. walter herd, director, army transition assistance program the visit to an army base that inspired a new initiative pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of fort irwin, the army’s training center in california. "the army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get ‘em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation," herd said. but johnson said he was also fortunate that fund for the arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in iraq and afghanistan. in addition to a team of several permanent staff members, where opportunity knox uses a proverbial army of "regional veteran connectors" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. in addition to the army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. given johnson’s worries about the applicability of his army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description. after a 29-year career in the army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in louisville, kentucky, a city he loves. in fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. "so we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society." the high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning iraq and afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers’ stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects. herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers. to pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. but johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for where opportunity knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program. you just don’t realize how many tools you have.’" "a lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they’ve learned," he observed. as a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today’s economy. soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from fort knox’s walls to return to the civilian world. the army spends two weeks on the first part, herd said, helping soldiers with "everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a résumé and job preparation." the hard part comes in translating those skills from army/navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable. "the hard part comes in translating those skills from army/navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable." through his work at fund for the arts, johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of louisville. kathy robinson, founder, turning point kathy robinson, founder of turningpoint, a boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work. they told him about an opening at fund for the arts, a louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in louisville’s underprivileged schools. "i told [fund for the arts ceo] christen boone, this is what [my ptsd] means and this is what i am doing to overcome it," johnson said. where opportunity knox helped give johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the army had prepared him well for a civilian career. fred johnson, army veteran and director of workplace giving, fund for the arts "when we attacked that city it was like a wasteland," johnson said. for one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the army in the first place. retired col. walter herd, director, army transition assistance program herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the united states as comprehensive as where opportunity knox. the population of the greater louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the great recession. that is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in october 2009 to 5 percent today. "we have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we’ve gotten past the recession, we’re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills." for post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in fort knox with job opportunities and communal life in louisville. for kentucky’s business community, where opportunity knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking. herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world. it just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, monster.com. translating "army-speak" to "corporate-speak" given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate. soldiers then learn concrete skills in the army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science. like many veterans, johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the army. i’m excited about where opportunity knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community. i’m excited about where opportunity knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community." "veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. "i had a certain idea in mind for what i wanted to do and they helped me work through that," johnson said. in 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. the military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? "the military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? the greater louisville, kentucky, area where fort knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families. he compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the iraqi city of baquba after the army brigade he led helped conquer it. the program has the enthusiastic backing of the u.s. army, but it does not take a dime from the government. unemployment in the louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in february 2010 to 4 percent today. when i was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs," robinson said. "as economic developers, workforce is a challenge," said eileen pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of where opportunity knox. army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region’s businesses tick, herd and pickett insist. the federal reserve bank of st. louis points to the greater louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. the latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues. there she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in afghanistan and iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas. it is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation. if they could make it through fort irwin, wouldn’t they make a superb supply chain manager for ups? fred johnson fred johnson volunteers with healing and the arts to help younger veterans cope with ptsd. the networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. those army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how where opportunity knox complements the army’s work. and it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater louisville area by 2017. but unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers. and while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think maker’s mark, woodford reserve and evan williams -- it is also the base of yum! but more valuable than the skills the army teaches soldiers are the "attributes" that service instills, herd said. "a lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they’ve learned," he observed. representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in fort knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. daniel marans retired col. walter herd is director of the army's transition assistance program. there are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military’s separation from civilian society. he explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it. i can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me i must visit louisville. this u.s. city is welcoming veterans with an innovative new program fred johnson is effusive. i knew what i wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense." now johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. louisville proper is home to ups’ worldport air hub, as well as two ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant humana. (the figures have since declined, but on the advice of the bureau of labor statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.) they graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble," herd said. "the vast majority of people in the army -- unless you don’t do your work, who cares? so in september 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched where opportunity knox to try to change that. local magazine business first recently named him one of louisville’s top 20 veterans in business. and those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators. where opportunity knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. i fit in as well there as at humana or brown-forman where everybody is wearing suits." every single one of them passes through fort knox before re-entering the civilian world. daniel marans eileen pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded where opportunity knox. "they helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. "the preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. "they are 21 years old -- i say, ‘no, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span. last year, johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty army service. same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority," johnson added. johnson, the army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. "i tell them, ‘follow your heart, not the money," johnson said. you just don’t realize how many tools you have.’" they graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble. the group uses art to help veterans cope with ptsd. on the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of baquba." he volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called arts and healing. where opportunity knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. they advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on rallypoint, an internal military professional networking site. that was before he met with the folks at where opportunity knox. both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work. "i wish every american could go through there," pickett said. "the west side [of louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. johnson is now the organization’s director of workplace giving. i tell them, 'follow your heart, not the money.' "you’ve gotta come, dude -- it’s awesome," johnson told me. "i said i am bringing more positive baggage than negative. i wish more ceos and executives had the courage." we are trying to do that here in louisville. the city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector. you can actually see the community change. "this is an up-and-coming town." "you can actually see the community change." "you can actually see the community change." "i was just inspired by it." and prove himself johnson has. it relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. visions of america/getty images the louisville, kentucky, skyline. and it has already racked up some impressive numbers. "then we helped rebuild the city. she took a chance on me. brands, parent company of kfc, pizza hut and taco bell. the reasons are complicated. the feeling is mutual.

"men’s shirts have more room, so it’s easier to slip them off over your head; women don’t have that option," he posits in the video above. "i think it’s that men aren’t as flexible and can’t, maybe, get their arms around like that." al roker has his own theory about why women do it: "i think it’s hotter." how men do it: how women do it: but why? and the today show’s matt lauer says we might finally have our answer. men, however, just reach behind their neck and yank their shirt off, much less gracefully. social media (especially the tumblr sleuths) has been on the case, trying to solve this mystery.
it’s a nasty image but one that’s meant to strike fear into the bolton’s enemies; the house was infamous for the centuries-old practice, and because ramsay had taken over winterfell, the sigil was prominently displayed in the show’s opening credits. as the opening credits rolled, a subtle but important change was made to the animation, causing fans of the show to shout with glee. it was a subtle change but a big moment for the show because of how important "battle of the bastards" was. prior to sunday’s finale, the castle at winterfell was adorned with the gruesome bolton sigil, which is a picture of a flayed man hanging upside-down. fans were understandably pumped about the change; all seems right in the game of thrones universe—at least for now. because jon is thought to be a bastard, custom dictates the colors of the sigil be reversed. but as of sunday’s finale, the stark sigil was back in its rightful place.   it didn’t take long for last night’s game of thrones finale to win fans over. instead of a gray direwolf on a white background, it’s now a white wolf on a gray background. game of thrones: did you catch this subtle change during the finale? also notable is that it reflects jon’s newfound status as king in the north. not an insignificant change, especially because jon’s new nickname is white wolf. unfortunately, it’ll be many months before the show returns for season 7, so we have a long way until we find out. with winter finally here, can jon ensure the survival of winterfell? did you miss it? observant viewers spotted it right away.
mac cosmetics lead makeup artist maki perfected a "natural and breathable" look on the costello tagliapietra girls by working mac pro sculpting creams underneath the cheekbones and opting for lofty brown zoom lash mascara instead of traditional black. backstage at lela rose and costello tagliapietra's spring 2014 shows, makeup artists dressed up the models' lids with an unusual shade: lime green. romy soleimani for beauty.com achieved this at lela rose by using a combination of stila color pigments in light show and cha cha eyeshadow on the eyes. with such a vibrant eyeshadow color on the lids, it is key to keep the rest of the face pared down. these makeup techniques not only brought out the golden undertones in the redhead models' complexions (which gave them a subtle glow), but it also accentuated the fiery hues in their hair color. the spring color worked surprisingly well on all the different models' skin tones, however, it stood out particularly on the redheads. the eyeshadow color redheads should be wearing is... she finished by blending mac pro lime eye shadow over the upper and lower eyelids to get a soft wash color. we've found the eyeshadow color you should be wearing next spring. then she balanced it with color balm lipstick in betsey (a creamy pink). attention redheads!
"i knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone," teixeira said. "i was a giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year," said judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the new york yankees. in 2016, judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner hal steinbrenner. headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for judge. boston -- when aaron judge was last a normal-sized human being, at about 9 or 10 years old, the player who made him run to his television was barry bonds. he remembers being around stanton in the arizona fall league in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now. holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on judge’s power. starlin castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take bp. "we are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it," headley said. "we are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ... "the smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. "there aren’t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any," holliday said. mark teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch nelson cruz launch some balls in the arlington heat when they were teammates in texas. judge’s 460-foot homer on saturday in pittsburgh was the third longest for a yankee since espn started tracking distances in 2009. but it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. matt holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in bp as if there'd be an exam afterward. he will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the american league. "judge’s power is right there with those two guys," said teixeira, now an espn analyst. he's the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see. he is exactly where you would hope he would be when i saw him a few years ago." he is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. "he is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. holliday has seen stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of judge. he said it might just be familiarity, but he would take judge in a distance contest. it's early, but judge has joined stanton as a player you can’t miss. in the past two seasons, judge has three of the four longest yankee homers. we feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen." on wednesday, judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the yankees-red sox rivalry. if there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550." his power, like bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away. five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. only alex rodriguez's 477-foot homer in august 2015 and juan miranda's 469-foot shot in october 2009 traveled farther. "obviously, stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that i’ve played against. judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far. judge is challenging the current champ, giancarlo stanton, as the king of the xxxl home run. 550 feet is not out of the question." only chase headley, with a 453-footer in july 2016, cracks the top four. in the final days, the yankees finally gave judge the nod over aaron hicks. judge grew up in linden, california, about two hours from what was then pac bell park. "i’m really happy we are in the same group. in 2013, teixeira played with stanton in the world baseball classic. it's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too.

concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system," write graduate student erica schulte and dr. ashley gearhardt of the university of michigan in plos one the authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as "loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so." "although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating," the authors write. to test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the yale food addiction scale , of which gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. according to science, this is the most addictive food in the world we all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? for instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs. gender was not found to be relevant; people with high bmis reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected. unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. the finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's "pleasure chemical" that's often implicated in addiction. using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. the students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors. a further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. iulian valentin/shutterstock if processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. however, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. as the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. they back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist. the respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (bmi) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. a match-up between caffeine and pizza’s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time. strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. several other foods – all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both – were tightly bunched behind. chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries. at the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. "we propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate. even water ranked higher than these.

experts still don’t fully understand why not getting enough sleep is connected to all of these conditions, but new research published this month adds one piece to the puzzle: not getting enough sleep may cause changes to gut bacteria that could fundamentally change our metabolism, affecting a host of bodily systems. what’s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night’s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases. additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. and while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes. the individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep ― a potential diabetes risk ― compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer. the study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. this new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, cedernaes explained. the finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, cedernaes explained. the terrifying way not sleeping enough actually changes your gut studies link insufficient sleep to some pretty scary consequences, including an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and even some cancers. gut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms living in our intestines that help keep our metabolism, immune system and other bodily functions running normally, explained senior study author jonathan cedernaes, a sleep researcher at uppsala university in sweden. the researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours. plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone’s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level. the amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent ― and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep. mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. the data showed that getting less sleep didn’t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. but getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, cedernaes said. but the new data makes a strong case, cedernaes said ― a strong case for catching your zs. "gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies," cedernaes said. there was yet another interesting finding from the study. "[they] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. they can also help us extract nutrients."
9 ways the new "beauty and the beast" is different from the original as everyone returned to work monday morning, it’s safe to assume rooms were buzzing with discussions about the highly anticipated "beauty and the beast" remake that debuted over the weekend. while they were new to moviegoers, "beauty and the beast" composer alan menken said they weren’t technically "new" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late howard ashman that didn’t make the cut in the original film. and in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. when maurice says that will never happen, gaston realizes maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves. questions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own. he starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of gaston’s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup. well, that’s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: there were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released "beauty and beast" a completely different feel from the original. rather than washing the clothes by hand, belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town. with a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the beast (dan stevens) and belle travel back in time to paris, where belle was born. the beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. while belle asks mrs. potts (emma thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. for example, the added lyric "i hunt, i sneak up with my quiver and i shoot in the liver" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, menken said it was perfect. therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never "protected" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a "beast" well before his physical transformation. in fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so. gaston loses his temper with maurice and says he only entertained maurice’s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. the beast doesn’t need any help reading a book, and belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point. as she overhears belle’s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. while trying to win the affection of his "future father-in-law," gaston pretends to believe maurice’s warning that a strange beast has taken his daughter, belle, captive. this is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate beast needed belle’s help sounding out words in the books. in the remake, there’s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before "the last petal falls," referring to the enchanted rose. while other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, belle’s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she’s not ashamed of it. little does he know, maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how gaston left him there to die. so he and lefou (josh gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking maurice to lead the way. while chip (nathan mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn’t alone. lefou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving maurice for dead, pleads with gaston to reconsider, but gaston pushes forward and returns to town without maurice. in the new film, josh gad’s character, lefou -- gaston’s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version. in the original "beauty and the beast," the audience simply knows "crazy maurice" (kevin kline) as a widower and belle as his apparent caretaker. when maurice approaches the path to the beast’s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. in the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. "lefou is somebody who on one day wants to be gaston and on another day wants to kiss gaston," director bill condon told attitude magazine. in the remake, belle (emma watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she’s also a teacher and inventor. gaston and lefou exchange glances, implying that maurice has lost it, and tell him it’s time to turn around. at the end of the movie, lefou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with belle and the prince. this time around, chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. "[they’re] not actually new lyrics, they’re actually howard ashman’s that were outtake things," menken told comicbook prior to the premiere in los angeles. here’s a look at nine ways the "beauty and the beast" remake differed from the original: warning: this post contains spoilers. some may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic. unlike in the original, the new beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting shakespeare and critiquing belle’s admiration for "romeo and juliet." belle take a long pause before finally telling the beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek. in the original film, mrs. potts told chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. the woman tells maurice to take belle away so she doesn’t catch the disease as well. at one point in the film, gaston asks lefou why he doesn’t have a lady. lyrics to one of the movie’s most popular songs, "gaston," sounded a little different than the original. behind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the beast and his castle. the beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with belle that his huge library really is wonderful. it was never clear who belle’s mother was or what happened to her. and the reason that they hadn’t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy." the live-action "beauty and the beast" remake made history by featuring disney’s first-ever "exclusively gay moment." the beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn’t always that way. a flashback between maurice and belle’s mom (zoe rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. in the 1991 animated movie, the beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. after spotting a doctor’s mask on the floor, the beast concludes belle’s mother died from the plague. it’s clear belle is one of the only literate women in town. it’s here the beast tells belle what happened to her mother. "we had also put some of the outtake lyrics from howard in the broadway show. in the remake, we found out that’s not entirely the case. mrs. potts, chip, lumiere (ewan mcgregor) and cogsworth (ian mckellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. it’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings." what happened to mrs. potts’ children, chip’s brothers and sisters? we assume, this time around, he’s mrs. potts’ only child. but thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. at that moment, it appears the curse is final. the pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. so he does, and the rest is history. lefou shrugs his shoulders and says he’s "too clingy." so how did the remake compare to the original? "he’s confused about what he wants. but maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. she held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. it’s "much smaller" than belle imagined. if only they believed him... the enchantress then disappears without a trace. it’s true. not cool, gaston (luke evans).

compared to those in the "tradition" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they’d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. (reuters) fresh off his vatican visit, democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders visits a church in brooklyn and says income inequality isn't just a political issue, it's a moral issue. fresh off his vatican visit, democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders visits a church in brooklyn and says income inequality isn't just a political issue, it's a moral issue. they marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine: in the next two experiments — one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults — researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling. [how democratic and republican morals compare to the rest of the world] luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. "those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality," the authors wrote. like this: "while your thoughts were similar to other students' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student." the magic word this researcher says can get people to agree with you (amy cavenaile/the washington post; istock) a new national poll about how american voters perceive donald trump and hillary clinton asked: who between the presidential front-runners has higher moral standards? in the study, published in the journal of experimental social psychology, ohio state university doctoral student andrew luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: they're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. but afterward, a post-test revealed the "moral" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the "practical" respondents (6.88). the researchers wanted to see if a person’s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be "moral." people's attitudes in the "morality" group and "practicality" group didn't significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. according to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality. after respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we'll be probably fighting about politics forever. the takeaway, according to luttrell: framing a cause as "moral" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. they slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution. some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected "tradition." so, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants. next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed "feedback" on their opinions. that could help the democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. the survey, released wednesday by quinnipiac university, didn't elaborate on what "moral" encompasses. we grow up thinking morality is this thing that's untouchable. clinton leads trump in this ambiguous category, 47 percent to 36 percent, according to the results. the group’s consensus: recycling is generally a good thing. simply telling someone their attitude was moral, luttrull found, gave it more power. what's moral is permanent and cannot be challenged." well, i won’t be swayed because i’m standing up for what’s right. some heard their views were "practical." others heard their ideas projected "morality." "is moral a magic word?" as in: oh, you disagree with me? "in some ways, it might be. then the researchers tried to change everyone’s mind. others heard "moral." (reuters) he said.
included below is the essay i wrote about a little show called buffy the vampire slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place – alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas freaks and geeks and my so-called life – among our pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as i get the mustard out... buffy the vampire slayer (wb, 1997–2001; upn, 2001–2003) total score: 94 tv show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. why buffy the vampire slayer was the best possible name for that show today is publication day for tv (the book): two experts pick the greatest american shows of all time, the anthology where matt zoller seitz and i rank the top 100 american sitcoms and dramas ever, and write essays about them, and a whole lot of other things (movies, miniseries, current shows, shows that weren't top 100-worthy but were sentimental favorites in some way, etc.). (see also terriers, selfie, crazy ex-girlfriend...) now, buffy the vampire slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because upn was looking to steal a hit from its rival the wb), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire tv network for the short but memorable existence of the wb. we're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, the ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on deadwood, while matt's home base at vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, the simpsons(*). you could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, buffy summers (sarah michelle gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. but he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them. (those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including "hush," an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; "the body," a stripped-down outing where buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode "once more, with feeling," where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.) except maybe this one: if you tell someone who"s never watched it that a show called buffy the vampire slayer is among the best tv dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy. (*) maybe my favorite section of the book – and the favorite of many of the early reviewers – is called the great debate, where matt and i argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place. in the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with buffy and her vampire love interest angel (david boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like buffy"s little sister dawn (michelle trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world). buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best tv shows ever set in high school, but it wasn"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. whedon once suggested to the new york times, "if i made buffy the lesbian separatist, a series of lectures on pbs on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. the name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you"re turned off by it, you"re probably not going to like the series to which it"s applied. if anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion? would a buffy the vampire slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? it was a series made cheaply even by the standards of tv"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for gellar. whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like "reign in blood" and "mandatory suicide." he knew that buffy the vampire slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make. turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show"s three seasons set in high school. certainly, you can imagine wb executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get joss whedon to shorten the title to just slayer. and a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player oz (seth green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full. if you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like trophy wife, don"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. the show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by gellar, anthony stewart head, alyson hannigan, and the rest of the cast. it was a tonal balance that director fran rubel kuzui didn"t even bother attempting with the campy buffy movie adapted from whedon"s first script. you can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by matt and me) at amazon, barnes & noble, ibooks, google play, kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller. if it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter ("i laugh in the face of danger. the idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium." whedon didn"t invent feminism in tv storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. and if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it. if it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. by any standard you want to measure, buffy was a success.

nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.data from the american institute for cancer research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. however, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.hot dogs were introduced by german immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.during the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. hot dogs are probably the most popular fast-food ever, as they have over 7 billion consumers in the world. even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts than in the traditional hot dogs. most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. the who (world health organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. the hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. it causes 4 types of cancer! these days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. stop eating this food immediately!

"twilight" star reveals his latest obsession these days, our knowledge of celebrities too often originates with paparazzi images and snarky quotes by anonymous "insiders." i don’t know what’s overrated.

in a new interview with ign on the set of "parks and recreation," pratt joked that his new superhero movie is going to be "the 'citizen kane' of movies other than 'citizen kane.'" chris pratt, who added all kinds of muscle to his frame to play star-lord in "guardians of the galaxy," continues to be the best. from the ign interview: plaza: do you get to have sex with an alien? "guardians of the galaxy" will also feature the voices of vin diesel (as an alien tree named groot) and possibly bradley cooper (as rocket raccoon, a machine-gun wielding raccoon). marvel is set to release the film on aug. 1, 2014. cool, but this exchange between pratt and his "parks" co-star, aubrey plaza, is way better. "guardians of the galaxy" is filming now in london. for the full pratt interview, which is a good one, head over to ign. marvel star jokes about alien sex because why not? pratt, zoe saldana, glenn close, john c. reilly, benicio del toro and lee pace are among the film's live-action stars. pratt: i can’t get too much into what we’ve shot.

careercast evaluated 200 professions and rated them on 11 measures of stress, such as the amount of travel required, the growth potential of the industry and job, and the physical demands of the role. the second-least stressful job was compliance officer, a role with a median salary of $65,640 that requires making sure your colleagues abide by laws and regulations. here are the best ones in 2017: stress plays a big role in our daily lives, and according to careers website careercast, some jobs create more anxiety than others. medical sonographers assist physicians in conducting and interpreting these tests, and to become one, you'll need to take an accreditation program that lasts between one and four years. also, much stress is self-induced and best managed by means other than switching jobs, like limiting the number of tasks you take on. the report isn't a survey careercast relies largely on data from the u.s. bureau of labor statistics to score every position on each metric, and then rolls that up into an overall stress score. although these jobs are rated as low-stress based on careercast's approach, by no means are they easy or unimportant. some, such as audiologist and tenured professor, require a ph.d. others, like medical and pharmacy technicians, provide critical support in the process of saving lives. diagnostic medical sonographer ranked first on careercast's list of the least stressful jobs. last week my colleague karsten strauss covered the most stressful jobs, and this week i'm writing about the least stressful. diagnostic medical sonographer was rated as the least stressful job. two years ago, my colleague susan adams published many interesting reader responses to an earlier version of this annual list. to see the 10 least stressful jobs and their median salaries, view the gallery below. looking for a job that doesn’t stress you out? for instance, having a difficult manager or extremely demanding clients can make any job unpleasant. operations research analyst ranked eighth, with median income of $78,630. a compliance officer at a bank might monitor traders to check if they're following insider trading regulations. careercast's stress ratings are averages, and exceptions always arise. but we wanted to publish this list because we think it's informative and thought-provoking. the position involves using medical imaging equipment like ultrasound machines. using mathematical and analytical methods, operations analysts help organizations solve complex problems. median pay in 2015 was $63,630. more methodology details are available here. photo credit: shutterstock.
psyblog also offers a list of those jobs least likely to be taken by psychopaths, and, as you'd expect, most are intensely focused on empathizing with or caring for others. and while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions. research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies these folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . according to research done by psychologist kevin dutton called the great british psychopath survey, some jobs seem to attract them and have higher than average numbers of psychopaths among their practitioners. and sorry, business leaders, you're not going to like which gig tops the list: ceo lawyer media (tv and radio) salesperson surgeon journalist police officer clergyperson chef civil servant some of these are more surprising than others. well, if you've ever watched a horror movie, you'll know to stay out of dark woods, unlit alleyways, and to never, ever go into the basement to investigate that strange noise down there. the 10 professions with the most psychopaths you, like most people, probably want to avoid psychopaths . though, i guess, upon reflection, you could see how a job regarded as especially holy might attract those obsessed with their own importance. according to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent psyblog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population . the other end of the scale is also interesting but perhaps offers fewer puzzlers. who would have guessed the clergy are prone to psychopathy, for instance? and i am, of course, personally shocked to see journalists here. but, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. also, how did politician not make the list? oh, and you should probably also avoid prison. psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday.

in case you're interested here is scarlett johansson's sat score during a sit down with darren aronofsky for interview magazine, scarlett johansson asked the director what his sat score was, and ended up revealing her own: i think the way it worked when i took them was that they were out of 1,600, so maybe you'd get a 1,240 if you were a smarty-pants. the 29-year-old "don jon" actress would have taken the sats around 2002, at which time the average score was 1020, making 1,080 slightly above average. i got a 1,080, which was pretty low. but that was probably because i didn't answer half of the math questions.

look who just launched a new free streaming-music service: playing catch up to music rivals spotify and pandora, google unveiled a free ad-supported version of its play music all access streaming service tuesday. by creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against spotify and pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free google listeners into paying customers. some of the nuts and bolts behind google's free streaming comes from google acquisition last year of songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. over the weekend, apple’s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer taylor swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period. but it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates. google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. on google music, swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. google says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free. but it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year. but google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels. the album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version. as competition heats up with apple in the mix, google will need a free service to pull in paid users. google’s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. spotify and pandora’s streaming services — both free and paid — have a big head start on google. songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to pandora and spotify, which are automated. in comparison, spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers. they can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music. tuesday's premiere by google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. google, with its new internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. as such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. users will be able to listen to curated radio stations based on genre, mood, decade or activity. marketers can buy ads as a part of the google display and video networks. google doesn’t disclose subscriber numbers. apple quickly caved in.
research suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism, due to their thermogenic effect on the body - in other words, the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food. an effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic foods to help you to achieve your goals, but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved as part of a balanced diet. from chili to mustard, how to turn 8 classic ingredients into bulge-beating superfoods you might be familiar with the notion that eating foods that are high in calories along with a lack of physical activity causes an imbalance in metabolism, which leads to obesity. mustard mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten. as with complex carbohydrates, these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds. the harder the food is to digest, the more calories the body will have to burn to fully break it down, before it can absorb the nutrients from it. whole grains and vegetables complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down. research has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain, in part also due to its positive effect on post-meal hunger and desire to eat. however, the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from person-to-person, varying in efficiency and requiring differing amounts of energy to process the foods and drinks consumed. a 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells. green tea studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body. black pepper piperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells. all foods, when consumed, speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract, using up energy and producing heat in the process. the thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet as a whole. so, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal. it is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage. proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process. the extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods. always ensure good protein with every meal or snack, not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full. use fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals. in our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat. eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production. thermogenesis kicks in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calories many hours after a meal is eaten. wouldn't it be fabulous to be able to eat foods that can help you lose weight, simply by eating them? chili peppers capsaicin, a compound in chilli peppers, stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat. although this doesn't quite make sense on first reading, you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that. protein when compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect. ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced, ready to use in a tea. use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost. however, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories. add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour. studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight. with this in mind, here are eight foods that can have a thermogenic effect on your body: 1. so, aim to reach your seven-a-day, of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits. therefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity. the tricky thing, for many of us, is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight. garlic like ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. ginger ginger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. use it in stir-fries, curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea. slice into thick discs and add hot water, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes. these vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre. for example, if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories, around 30 percent (i.e. choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears. vegetarian protein sources include quinoa, beans, brown rice and lentils. 100 calories) will be burned during digestion. 8. this is known as thermogenesis. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7. 3.
on the other hand, the nickname isn’t nearly as much fun as some of the ones suggested by twitter users earlier this month: the word "intrepid" also brings to mind the uss intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier that saw service during world war ii and vietnam and is now a museum ship in new york city. the word "intrepid" also brings to mind the uss intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier that saw service during world war ii and vietnam and is now a museum ship in new york city. "the bill press show" broke the news about the democratic presidential candidate on its twitter feed on thursday morning, according to merriam-webster, the word intrepid is "characterized by resolute fearlessness, fortitude and endurance." sanders’ supporters on twitter love the nickname: bernie’s secret service code name is "intrepid." bernie sanders' secret service code name is... vermont sen. bernie sanders‘ secret service code name is... intrepid. sanders, however, has opposed many military actions including the vietnam war and the war in iraq. i think i will start referring to him by that name.
dr kenneth koch recently revealed the best time of day to do number two's, and to our surprise it's in the mornings - right after you wake up to be precise. however... this is only healthy if it becomes the norm - so you need to go poop every morning after you wake up in order for it to be considered beneficial. "you can think of 100 reasons you don't have time, but have that breakfast, recognise that urge to have a bowel movement, and then take the time. revealed: people who poop at this time of day are healthiest there's an ideal window for taking sh*ts you guys. he says that it's do with your small intestine and colon working overtime while you sleep. that's how you get into a regular movement."
although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on nov. 30. stokes said he feels responsible for spreading the word about the unknown challenges of being a minority student at ucla and the ongoing lack of diversity on campus. in the video, stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. in an email statement to the school paper, janina montero, vice chancellor of student affairs, said administrators acknowledge the need for more diversity and are attempting to work within the state's admission parameters. this university has more ncaa championships than black male freshmen the black students at university of california, los angeles, sent a strong message about diversity at their school. a group of students, led by sy stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. "we certainly recognize that the low numbers of african americans and other underrepresented students on campus does lead to a sense of isolation and invisibility," montero said in her email statement. stokes, a third-year afro-american studies student who identifies as black, cherokee and chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue. the students' video adds to the ongoing affirmative action debate both inside and outside of the state, raising awareness about diversity at institutions around the country. "being the cousin of arthur ashe, i feel as though it is my responsibility to uphold the strong voices of the black bruin community," he said. according to the school's enrollment statistics, african-americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. the state of california voted down affirmative action in 1996 and passed proposition 209, which banned state schools from considering race, gender, ethnicity or national origins in their admissions processes. in an interview with the daily bruin, stokes said he almost dropped out of ucla during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. namely, the fact that there isn't much when it comes to african-american males, a troubling fact for one of the state's most elite institutions. this school has experienced unacceptable instances of injustice recently, and many people are not aware of what is happening at this university." "it is difficult to eliminate this painful imbalance without considering race in the admissions process." black student enrollment has severely decreased since that provision and critics are saying that has to change. of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black. "we had to do something to put our issues on the map," stokes said.
to separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1⁄2-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. "a mother’s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother’s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother’s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair," they write. only in the past decade or so has "no child left alone" become the social and legal norm in the u.s. a doctoral student in cognitive science at the university of california at irvine, thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what’s going on. ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services! the unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn’t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade. it’s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car. if you leave your kids alone, it’s not predatory strangers who are a risk once, when she was in about the first grade, she even found a snake. the result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse. "that is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so." that was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral). "when you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don’t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you," thomas says. asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident. the chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually. "in contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult," they note. take what happened to julie koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an evanston, illinois, starbucks for three minutes. as a child, ashley thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in ojai, california. "the reason i knew it was ok was i had also gone by myself to the library to take a snake safety class." yet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation. because the child’s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical. when she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying. officials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician’s exam, demanded that koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications. "people don’t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral," the researchers write. the same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally. but it taught koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances. you don’t think about whether the store you’re taking your child into might get held up. she knew she hadn’t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene. "there’s no way i would have picked up a snake in front of my parents," she says. it could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover. thomas and her co-authors note that legal norms needn’t follow inaccurate beliefs about risks. after all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low. "the fact that many people irrationally fear air travel does not result in air travel being criminalized," they write. the researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting. "parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes. people rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment. she rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there. she wasn’t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation. it comes from people who think they’re doing good. "they also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous. indeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks. the real stranger danger doesn’t come from would-be kidnappers. but survey respondents didn’t see things this way at all. "you can pretend you’re the queen of sheba," she says. the investigation determined that the report of abuse was "unfounded." would that have affected the outcome of the case?" the reasons for the parent’s absence were varied randomly. they lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks. "what if i was taking an anti-depressant? playing on her own let her imagination soar. koehler is a public defender in the homicide division. moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks. what’s going on? these beliefs don’t just affect busybodies. (yes, a snake safety class.) news reports and crime shows feed exaggerated fears. she asks. nor should you.

she supported the coup in honduras in 2009 and in ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the u.s. and nato intervention in libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of muammar ghaddafi’s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in afghanistan ordered by president obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward russia. expect hillary to do this almost immediately if she wins in november july 1, 2016 | nick bernabe (antiwar) thirteen years of wars in the middle east, since the illegal and criminal invasion of iraq by the united states and britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed iraq, syria, yemen, and libya, and created millions of refugees. in fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in syria has a lot to do with iran, its strategic alliance with syria, its use of syrian territory to help the lebanese hezbollah, and more generally what the sunni arab regimes of the region consider as the "shiite crescent" – the alliance between the shiites in iran, iraq, syria, saudi arabia, bahrain, and lebanon. even though clinton’s most important "accomplishment" as secretary of state, namely, attacking libya under the guise of "humanitarian intervention," which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the bbc and voice of america in october 2011 she claimed that iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called "friends of syria" group, consisting of several western nations and the very arab regimes that despise iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in syria, namely, saudi arabia, qatar, united arab emirates, and jordan, as well as turkey. in an interview with abc in 2008, when mrs. clinton was running for president, she was asked what she would do if iran attacked israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, "i want the iranians to know that if i’m the president, we will attack iran. thus, to her destroying syria in order to topple bashar al-assad became the pathway for attacking iran, which she views as necessary for israel’s sake, as the clintons have deep connections to israel and its lobby in the united states her advocacy of direct us intervention in syria began carefully. while the leaders of iran’s green movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of june 2009, rejected any us help, clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the us was prepared to help them the way it helped libyan rebels. the group is similar to the contact group on libya, also known as "friends of libya," which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to. in may 1995 former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the us by awarding the american oil company conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the persian gulf, although a european oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. jake sullivan, hillary clinton’s senior policy adviser, said on january 21, "this proposal [by sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with iran not only breaks with president obama’s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that’s been working for the united states." three times over the past 20 years the iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the united states, and in each case the clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it. the missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the united states claims, do not violate un security council resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. if she is elected president, she may get to add both to her "impeccable" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark world war iii, if it has not already begun as a result of us policy toward the middle east. for example, it is well known that iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with p5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the united states opposed it and still do. in fact, many senior israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer hamas to run gaza, because the alternative would be either daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it, why is mrs. clinton so anti-iran? at the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the president and his vice president joe biden, to even the editors of the new york times that saudi arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the middle east. iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if iran attacked israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless israel attacks first), she would defend israel. but, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, bill clinton announced that iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the united states, as if that would impress any iranian. and as secretary of state she supported massive sale of advanced us weapons to saudi arabia and its allies in the persian gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack yemen. but, instead of responding in kind, bill clinton imposed total trade embargo on iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed "dual containment" policy according to which both iran and iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box. by taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with iran, hillary clinton is a strong ally of iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the united states. so, the iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. in an interview with the cnn she claimed syria and iran (as well as russia) helped creating the daesh, saying, "isis was primarily the result of the vacuum in syria caused by assad first and foremost. not only had khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the majles[iranian parliament] in february 2000. daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of iraq that led to the emergence of al-qaeda in iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in libya and syria. one of her top aides, ann-marie slaughter who was director of policy planning at the state department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the new york times in february 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in syria. now that she is running for president again, clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as secretary of state, hard choices. not only does hillary clinton not want improved relations with iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes iran. the clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with iran, but khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against iran would first be lifted, which were not. one is that hillary clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the middle east, because she believes in american "exceptionalism" and always speaks about "american global leadership," which only means world dominance. there can be no doubt in tehran that if iran’s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the united states will stop them. in addition to constantly demonizing iran, hillary clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on iran to carry favor with the pro-israel lobby and its rich donors. the terrorist attacks by daesh (also known as isis or isil) in europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east have strengthened xenophobia, islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. clinton’s rhetoric regarding iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of president hassan rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with tehran’s hardliners. not only can they, we should expect new wars in the middle east if hillary rodham clinton, the presumptive democratic candidate for president is elected next november. when asked during her first democratic presidential debate last october "which enemy are you most proud of," hillary clinton included "the iranians" among them. as secretary of state mrs. clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of western nations that imposed "the toughest sanctions" in history on iran. despite clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with iran, p5+1 and iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in july 2015 after iran made many significant concessions. so, before the war began in syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between israel and syria as a way of separating the latter from iran. yet, hillary clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. her threat to obliterate iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: attacking iran with nuclear weapons. this article (expect hillary to do this almost immediately if she wins in november) by muhammad sahimi, originally appeared on antiwar.com and was used with permission. in the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them" (emphasis mine). i believe iran is the subject of the agreement" (emphasis mine), as if iran is a banana republic that is subject to us will. even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the middle east will be. after all, it was during her husband’s presidency that toppling the regime of saddam hussein became the official policy of the united states. after hillary clinton was elected a senator from new york in 2000, she supported every resolution by congress imposing unilateral sanctions on iran. although hillary clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles iran. for example, similar to benjamin netanyahu she always refers collectively to iran, daesh and the palestinian group hamas, as if they are allies. they will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. anything that she wants for the middle east is intended for making the region as "safe" for israel as possible. those who argue that we should vote for clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. they need to understand that america will act decisively if iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary." then, in 1998 former reformist president proposed "dialogue among civilizations" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. that is not true, at least not when iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and clinton and tehran’s hardliners are no exception. in a speech at the brookings institution last september, clinton declared, "i don’t see iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. to see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of aipac in march. the cliché in the west is that it is iran that does not want improved relations with the west. after the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between iran and the united states would slowly develop. expect new catastrophic wars in the middle east, especially one with iran, if she is elected. the only "accomplishments" that she is still lacking are starting a war with iran and invading syria. people often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in iraq and her enthusiasm for it. during the primary season the clinton campaign slammed senator sanders’ suggestion that the us and iran should have closer relations. along with the neocons, the clintons have always been iran’s number one enemy in the us political establishment. all such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the united nations security council. clinton is not bothered by the fact that israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, tehran’s hardliners? yes, for decades if not longer elections in the united state have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. iran cut off its financial aid to hamas after that organization refused to back bashar al-assad in syria. despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, mrs. clinton quickly called for new sanctions against iran. why does she want to reshape the middle east and possibly change the borders? but, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than iraq. she sees iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the middle east. in an article in thejewish journal she threatened iran again, "we have to send iran an unequivocal message. they are also raping the poor nation of yemen with us logistic and military support. apparently, hillary clinton considers all iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing. but, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to israel’s intransigence. if she meant the iranian government, why did she not say so? but, in addition to demonizing iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. in other words, the us would have tried regime change in iran. this brings us to the second reason for her being anti-iran. iran has been fighting daesh in both syria and iraq. hillary clinton is simply as terrible as donald trump, if not worse. the sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary iranians. there is absolutely no relation between hamas and daesh. i can think of at least two reasons. aided and abetted by iran and russia." but, hillary clinton has gone even further. clinton considers syria and iran closely linked. was she talking about 80 million iranians? hillary clinton is a hawk and warmonger. this is of course neither new nor surprising. clinton is an israel "firster." can things get any worse? this was truly disturbing. this is not surprising. but, not this time. if you spot a typo, email edits@theantimedia.org. anti-media radio airs weeknights at 11pm

ex-nfl player suspected in the death of his cellmate april 16 - a california coroner has ruled that the death of a former nfl player's prison cellmate was a homicide by strangulation, the los angeles times reported on thursday. (reporting by curtis skinner in san francisco; editing by michael perry) prison officials said phillips was placed in a separate unit pending the outcome of their investigation. lawrence phillips, 39, was suspected in the death of 37-year-old damion soward, who was found unresponsive in their cell on saturday and died at a local hospital the next day, officials at the kern valley state prison said on monday. the times reported on wednesday that the kern county coroner's office said soward died of neck compression asphyxia, and that his death was a homicide. officials said phillips entered the prison in the central california city of delano in october 2008 and was serving a sentence of 31 years and four months for domestic violence, false imprisonment and vehicle theft. prison officials said phillips was placed in a separate unit pending the outcome of their investigation. phillips played for three nfl teams over four years in the 1990s, ending his career with the san francisco 49ers in 1999. the los angeles times reported that soward was a gang member who was convicted of executing a member of a rival gang. it said prison officials there were also investigating a separate case involving another inmate over the death of another cellmate. phillips had also been convicted of driving his car into three teenagers after a pickup football game in an unrelated case, according to local media. (reporting by curtis skinner in san francisco; editing by michael perry) soward was serving a sentence of 82 years to life for first-degree murder, prison officials said. local media said at the time the charges stemmed from two instances where he choked his girlfriend, including once where she lost consciousness. representatives for the coroner's office could not be immediately reached.

a complete stranger saved this mom and her 4 kids but wanted 1 major thing in return after tawny nelson's car broke down at night in the pouring rain with her four young daughters crying in the back, countless people just drove by as she begged for help. after the kind stranger left, tawny asked the mechanic if she could set up a payment plan, but he informed her that the man had already taken care of the bill. the single mother of four explained that things had been rough since her partner left — her vehicle was in such bad shape that she only drove if absolutely necessary and her cell phone was disconnected. things had been absolutely awful, more so than i care to explain, and without knowing us or our situation this kind man helped us in ways he will never know." he handed her a plate of food and bottles of water for her family and let her know that a tow truck was on its way and that his wife was going to drive them home. and while she knows that she can never repay him — he wouldn't even take a hug — she hopes to one day do for another what he did for her. "he said that the only payment the older man wanted was for me to never give up and keep being an amazing mom," tawny wrote. as her newborn screamed, her 2-year-old cried from hunger, and her 9-year-old desperately tried to help, tawny described that she started to break down herself. "i must have asked more than twenty people in the course of two hours for a jump," she wrote to frank somerville, which he shared on his facebook page. the next day, the gentleman returned to her house with a mechanic and they made multiple repairs to her car. however, one of her girls accidentally left a light on in the car and they returned to a completely drained battery. at that moment, a 74-year-old man with a bad limp knocked on the window. tawny is grateful to the man for restoring her faith in humanity when she says she was falling apart. she and her children desperately needed groceries so they made a quick trip to the store. "i was bawling and felt like the worst mom ever," she recalled. [they] just acted like i didn't exist." "i've never cried so hard in my life. not even a no. "they all ignored me.
"the challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years. he’s the ceo and founder of sunshare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. "it’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. "that’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. "we think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. yet change is not always easy, and david has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power. "i think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. as he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. "it’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy." local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill. "our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. you end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system," he says. in addition to the choices available to people, david predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output. "what we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time," says david. so you’re working with this industry that’s built on a dos platform with dos economics. by that, i mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism," says david. previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off. "so you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country." changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force." you’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers." one word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is "choice." you can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. sunshare started in colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to minnesota and new york. that’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. you’re basically going from one of those old dos operating systems to windows xp. the gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. what you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities," says david. what will make the future of energy terrorist-proof? david amster-olszewski has a distinctive perspective on the future of energy. energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. it’s that much of a difference. it’s a completely different experience," he says.
these scans would need to document a series of changes — starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks. as the ultrasounds scans mounted up for ms grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other. about 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the australian swamp wallaby. possible superfetation has been observed in cows i might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as "a desperate and final attempt" to get pregnant. aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares. it was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then — while pregnant — had conceived a second time. normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant. there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. people don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get. anyhow, ms grovenburg was pregnant — but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac. ms grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child. in other words, mrs grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first. the daily mail claimed that, in a "desperate and final attempt to have children of their own", the couple had given it one last try. third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. for humans, more babies each breeding cycle isn't always a plus — especially if you're trying to get a good night's sleep. in other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development? the first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg. it's a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while it's rare, it can happen. this plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg. two thousand years ago, that great greek thinker aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare. this means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season. almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. these changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall. a typical case is that of julia grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from arkansas. superfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature. we would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that. can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? in humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon. if you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the abc. but one was much larger and more developed than the other. female european brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant. now we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. but amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 — a few weeks apart. it makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate. even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. wondering if you can get pregnant during a pregnancy? dr karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation. the second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. #science can humans become pregnant while already pregnant? this is a curious use of the word desperate. 🤔  dr karl has the answer for you. but there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation. it's possible, but rare. the technical term for this is superfetation. and he was right.

unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots "all of your features need to be reachable solely through words—so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial," explains matty mariansky, who created meekan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform slack. you don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time. what’s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on—broadly described as conversational user interface (ui)—is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; ‘designing’ a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. while mark zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical ui rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. this type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which twitter’s co-founder and medium founder ev williams aptly describes as "stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want." this type of shift—the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft—could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers. to handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (ai) that can more holistically mimic human conversations. that’s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope send and recieve api for bot creators, facebook has also released bot engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions. setting up this type of experience is similar to using twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts. by virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. for instance, since facebook messenger may already know of some services and companies you "like" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. the underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven’t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions. it would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you’d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were—or perhaps before you even knew you were. ai-powered news looking to the future, you can imagine an ai-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of shakespeare over text. chatbots while potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment. once they set up their relationship with a service like stripe or facebook messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. bbc uses viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having its editorial staff role play facebook’s messenger and whatsapp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide. facebook messenger weaves chatbots with friends "facebook is a bit like that big dog galloping toward you in the park," said the late new york times journalist david carr, bemoaning the influence the social media giant has had on publishers’ distribution—and, in turn, monetization. to answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it. these writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news. as of the beginning of this year, according to business insider’s intelligence reports, the top four messaging apps—wechat, viber, facebook messenger and whatsapp—have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps—twitter, linkedin, facebook and instagram—in their aggregate monthly active users. predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, the economist and buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. this problem isn’t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, "we’re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small," says benedict evans, a partner at the venture capital fund andreesen horowitz. quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story. forbesbot on telegram cnn created a similar bot on facebook messenger using the just-released send and receive api, and publications like forbes and techcrunch have created bots on the messaging platform telegram using bot creator chatfuel. the current limitations of chatbots haven’t stopped messaging platforms like telegram, kik and facebook messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like the washington post from creating their own homegrown bots. why messaging is different text messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. the bbc recently used viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case. purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., "kasich") contained within that original bot message. it wouldn’t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed. in this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion. while easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why the economist deemed the exercise a "brand building initiative." while we don’t currently have ai-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories. the promise of true ai—an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale—is far too meaningful to give up on. this ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. according to emarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that’s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. in its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. as in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. at a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on whatsapp. as opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences. the most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created. this focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. it doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email. the seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. it can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to. by virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. it’s the most widely used smartphone feature in the u.s., and it’s already taking a bite out of social media. also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. "but driving in central rome or moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: what does that hand gesture mean?" will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? when the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like siri and alexa, language is the user experience. in taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. as soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list. this unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. this intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like apple’s siri or amazon’s alexa. the people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. but this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. the guardian hosted a whatsapp chat alongside the gop debates in december, and the huffington post ran a similar effort around various news topics on viber. text messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. there are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences. this problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news. in the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. while it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising. to successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful. the expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. "more often than not, it’s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you." on the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again. in this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. this could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites. this new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. for instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. this rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. for instance, mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request. in this vein, facebook messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages. now, facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging. journalists don’t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold. as of this week, facebook messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. the technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. for instance, facebook messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. so, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. editorial experiments before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. how should publishers and news organizations utilize the text messaging medium? but how should publishers and news organizations play with it? as an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even facebook. cost center or revenue stream? and that number has grown rapidly since.
a farmer got more than he bargained for when he dug up this on christmas day on christmas day 2015, a farmer was out on his land and found what he thought looked like a fossil. he found the shell partly covered in mud and dug around it to find out what it was. he thought his find might have been something archeologically significant so he was ready to share whatever it was that he found. farmer jose antonio nievas made the find near a stream on his farm in carlos spegazzi, which is 25 miles from buenos aires, argentina. he alerted a television station to his discovery.
according to the rubicon project while we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. here's how much you're going to spend on the holidays this year it may feel like it’s too early to even talk about holiday shopping, but in reality, two out of five millennial shoppers have already started buying presents for the holiday season. while we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it’s not surprising that cyber monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device. even if you’re opposed to buying in october, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash. "my fiancé and i are going to hawaii on our honeymoon, so we’re getting each other an experience while we’re there, that’s the only one i’m really waiting on." not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it’s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend. buying now means if something goes wrong, i can pay for it all and not feel like i have to choose between [buying] presents or fixing my car if it were to break," she says. "it really helps to spread out the spending that i want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences i want to give to others," says erin. the rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. as for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers. i can compare prices a little easier than in the stores, and i use cash back extensions on my browser which helps get some money back." (the men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they’d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they’ll spend on themselves.) right now i have all the friend presents, my mom’s present and i know what i’m getting for everyone," says erin. and the sooner you start, the more you’ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in december. we’re not even into october yet, so there’s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. the survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year’s average of $1,051. parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she’s completed her shopping. according to the holiday consumer pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. walmart and amazon are still predicted to be in the top retail spots for 2016 holiday shopping, but millennials heavily favor amazon. "i start saving early so i have a little stash that i know is for others. she puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn’t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. it also spaces out her spending, and ensures she’s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases. she shops for her immediate family, her fiancé, her fiancé’s parents and her two best friends. of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015. some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up. so i make sure i try to cross things off my list early in the process." of those surveyed, 42% will shop on black friday, but 47% will capitalize on cyber monday deals. parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. she says it’s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule. "for the parents, nana and brother, my fiancé and i usually split the cost which helps tremendously. this is based off 1,003 interviews rubicon conducted in late august 2016. millennials aren’t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. however, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. "most of [my shopping] will be online," says erin. in addition, cyber monday sales might rival black friday sales this year. and l ike erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing. male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. "also, august through february is my busiest time at work. their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). erin dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. "it’s just easier that way.
today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller's lucky. that was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on ebay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars." entire books have been written on the beanie bubble, but suffice to say that unless you're sitting on one of the princess diana bears (priced on ebay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the salvation army. as slate's mark stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999: the britannia bear wasn't just a toy, we explained it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade. "what was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to." today, as the ebay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the statute of liberty centennial plate selling for $0.99 and most norman rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece. for many millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars). one month later, the company that developed beanie babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year... today, the britannia beanie baby sells for $10 on ebay. americana with americana popular around the same time as coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: smallville, u.s.a. houses decorated from front to back with american flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. unlike collectibles like hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and norman rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer. our father capitulated and bought us each a britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector's item. back in the 1940s and 1950s, america seemingly couldn't get enough of coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. "i did a lot of time in the '70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell," he said. after gi's returned from germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. no matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place. whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the declaration of independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered. the idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that today's audience were all comic book readers when they were younger." roseville pottery where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. yet kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million ipo in 1994. prices represented how likely you were to find another kinkade around the block -- "local scarcity" as dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. by the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts. thomas kinkade paintings another success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the '80s and '90s, thomas kinkade, the "painter of light," was absolutely everywhere. the trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with. hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place. his paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. a piece was as valuable as the supply of roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. a collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively. for the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. (although dixey disagreed with that, arguing that comic books "are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of chippendale's furniture.") while the company itself went out of business in 1954, roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. no one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there. "is one of those things that's totally driven by the collector group that's no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace." as marsha dixey, consignment director with heritage auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. lunch boxes on the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old fraggle rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and gatorade might help send your kids to college. "if you think back, it was a year or two ago, the seth rogan movie the interview and all the brew-ha-ha about sony pictures not releasing it. to understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think. nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the statue of liberty centennial, the world series and norman rockwell's paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by qvc and late-night television. today much of the collector's world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, magic the gathering, can still command enormous value. by its peak, thomas kinkade signature galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010. for a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations. "one of the things that ebay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market," griffith said. what drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to earth? 10 worthless collectibles and the reasons they lost their value few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment. those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch... well, maybe the price of lunch. prior to the internet and sites like ebay, i could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. this also brought prices tumbling back down when those "collectibles" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. what the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just aren't that valuable. while prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. in fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. when it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an investment. "i had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them," dixey said. whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof. like with thomas kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. when baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that. comic books if flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? there must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper. coca-cola memorabilia as jim griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for ebay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. "there is no greater evidence of that," griffith said, "than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media. although billed as a collector's item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with. unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane. until the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot. collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get. "the frenzy of buying american collectibles and american antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn," griffith said. one of the most popular collectibles in american history, hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years. hummel represented the end of the war years while thomas kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation. "it would be a mistake," he said, "not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically." as kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. commemorative plates for some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge. one of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations. beanie babies "almost 20 years ago now, beanie babies came along ,and it created a furor," dixey said. it's what wiped out collectors of roseville pottery, and it will be back later on this list. prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white tv tray they could. all of a sudden there's a glut of them and it brings the price down." galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time. when the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. a brief fad, america practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late '90s. "it started at a price point where people could afford to buy it... and then it escalated." from pogs to marbles to cabbage patch kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. at one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. the value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights. endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. "there were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money." with the internet, i could connect to every piece of roseville in the world." "then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork," dixey added. over the course of the 20th century, goebel, the parent company that owned hummel, decided to break that model. while rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless. (contrary to popular rumor, however, the smith & wesson coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. aside from the highest value items, comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days. part of it is simple lack of research, but part, griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking. the disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality. the bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a german nun, maria innocentia hummel. america simply doesn't have the love affair with its pastime that we once did. a combination of the two factors we've already discussed: market glut and the internet. "what things don't have a value anymore that people think should," she said. (a single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000.) it is often, he said, about a "shared cultural moment." the reason, griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. as long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards. "you go back to the old adage of supply and demand. it's that they have far less value than people assume. when shoppers can go home and google up 800 more, not so much... 7. dixey had a front row seat for the beanie baby explosion. that particular rule hit the market for coca-cola collectibles hard. once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that t.k.s. after all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt? now, to a degree, kinkade's work was value-driven. as with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. hummel figurines most people have heard the name "hummel" before. it's not that baseball cards have no value. americana collectors slept under uncle sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames. first and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand. today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information. for years, roseville pottery was a collecting craze. baseball cards cards are another quintessential collector's item. today, those posters will go for a few bucks. today, as interested has waned, so too has demand. unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come. "those cultural moments change very quickly," griffith said. the reason goes back to cultural moments. historians are still struggling to explain it. baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint. "suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. that dream extends into collectibles. not so much. yet perception often lags. 1. what happened? 5. today? 10. 9. 4. 6. 2. 8. 3.
it also cited previous reasons given for the suspension of the evacuation: that rebels had sought to take prisoners with them and had bombarded a road due to be used by the buses set to conduct the evacuation from the two villages, al-foua and kefraya. (ap) – the evacuation of civilians and opposition fighters from eastern aleppo have been suspended after rebels opened fire on a convoy at one of the crossing points of the rebel-held enclave, according to syrian state tv. a turkish official said his country’s aid organisations are helping syrians who have been evacuated from aleppo to a border area held by the opposition in syria’s idlib province. in the central province of hama, buses and ambulances were waiting to evacuate thousands of people from two shia villages besieged by rebels, a last-minute condition which became part of the ceasefire deal for aleppo. however, a military news service run by lebanon’s pro-damascus hizbullah group said the evacuation had been halted partly due to a failure to evacuate wounded people from two shia villages besieged by rebels in idlib. meanwhile, russian president vladimir putin said he and his turkish counterpart are working to launch a new round of peace talks between the syrian government and the opposition — negotiations which would take place in kazakhstan’s capital, astana. lebanon-based al-mayadeen tv said buses which were parked at the ramouseh crossing point in southern aleppo had left the area after it was targeted by gunmen. deputy prime minister veysi kaynak said on friday that "20 buses from aleppo have reached the safe zone under control of the free syrian army in idlib". mr putin, speaking during on a visit to japan on friday, said ankara had helped to broker the rebel exit from aleppo that is currently under way. mr kaynak said there had been a discussion with syrian opposition forces over the possibility of establishing a centre "within a security zone in syria". it was not immediately clear how long the suspension, which was announced within a couple of hours after the evacuations resumed on friday, would last. the russian leader said that once the syrian army secures control of all of aleppo, civilians will be able to return to their homes. it was not immediately clear if western-backed syrian opposition would accept such a location for peace talks with mr assad’s government. ikhbariya tv also claimed that the rebels tried to take with them captives they had seized and were holding in the rebel enclave. earlier, syrian state tv reported that four convoys of fighters and civilians had departed from the rebel enclave on friday. hizbullah, an iran-backed lebanese shia group, is fighting on the side of president bashar al-assad in syria’s civil war. he estimated there are 80,000 to 100,000 individuals who would like to leave aleppo under the ceasefire deal which turkey helped broker. iran had demanded that the evacuations from foua and kefraya be tied in with the mass movement out of eastern aleppo. he said he and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan are also working for an overall truce in syria. he added that turkey is willing to provide assistance to "legitimate" syrian opposition groups to help meet their needs. the minister spoke after visiting the cilvegozu border crossing with syria in southern turkey. he said 30-35 injured people were being treated at the sahra hospital just over the border. he told the private dogan news agency that "idlib has no physical capacity to accommodate so many people". oh?
i don’t know about you, but i can’t believe that a farmer could uncover so much by moving one stone. i can't believe it leads to this in the country of scotland, a farmer came across a stone one day that looked like it had been purposely placed there. at first the farmer thought he had uncovered a house, but no, it was so much more. in the middle of each home was a waterproof basin which archaeologists believe was used to hold caught fish that was to be eaten for meals. the farmer had uncovered the lost and hidden city of skara brae. at the peak of the city’s existence, historians believe that the city held close to 50 to 100 people. this city, found on the island of orkney, has a rich history behind it as one of the oldest settlements ever recorded in great britain. when the farmer decided to turn the stone over, he uncovered something he could’ve never imagined. this lost city of skara brae is believed to be over 5,000 years old. what did you think of the hidden city of skara brae? that would mean that this city would be older than any pyramid found in egypt! i guess it pays off to have a curious mind — don’t you think? because the entire city became covered in sand dunes, most of the city was preserved very well. would you want to come and visit the city yourself? when he moves it? these homes provided more than just shelter though. let us know in the comments below! we want to hear your thoughts. this rock seems out of place.
channel 4 has revealed the latest celebrities to brave the most dangerous show on tv it's a crop of olympians, retired sportsmen and reality tv stars despite making a name for itself as one of the most dangerous reality shows in tv history, producers of channel 4's the jump have managed to secure a fresh load of celebrities in time for its new series. as was confirmed yesterday, sir bradley wiggins - who announced his retirement from cycling last weekend -  will be hitting the ski slopes when the new series begins at the end of the month. expect the usual array of reality tv stars with the only way is essex's lydia bright and spencer matthews who made his name on made in chelsea. meanwhile, josie gibson, winner of channel 4's final series of big brother in 2010, will be reunited with presenter davina mccall. former rugby players gareth thomas and jason robinson obe also appear on the line-up as does former premier league footballer robbie fowler and gymnast louis smith who has a strictly come dancing win to his name. other celebrities that'll be taking part include fellow gold medallists jade jones mbe (taekwondo) and kadeena cox mbe who won gold for both sprinting and cycling at the 2016 paralympics. last year saw numerous contestants seriously injure themselves throughout the course of the series with beth tweddle, rebecca adlington and tina hobley all being hospitalised. the jump returns to channel 4 later this month. other participants include comedian mark dolan, supermodel caprice, model and tv presenter vogue williams and broadcaster emma parker-bowles.
it gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. the surprising thing you never have to do in watch dogs 2 the surprising thing you never have to do in watch dogs 2 by dirk libbey there's a lot to do inside the san francisco of watch dogs 2. i had a chance to sit down with both watch dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where i learned that it's possible to beat watch dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. something interesting is our lv director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...he used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. i found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when i would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew i was there. christopher morin told me to "think like a hacker" while playing watch dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. as a fan of the hacking aspect of the original watch dogs but not so much the grand theft auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. this has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. jonathan morin, the creative director of watch dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. the addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. however, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. the great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. however, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. the development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. while my hands-on time with watch dogs 2 was limited, i can say i also never used a gun. sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so i'm super proud of that actually. however, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. ubisoft has tried to design watch dogs 2 so that players have more control. you don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. will you try to beat watch dogs 2 without using a gun? instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. blended from around the web comments facebook back to top back to top back to top let us know your play style in the comments below. this is kind of our goal. can we achieve that?
gosselin: i can see cowboys qb tony romo playing all 16 games if this happens dallas cowboys quarterback tony romo (9) leads the team during a warm-up at the team's last practice at valley ranch on thursday, june 16, 2016, in irving, texas. the o-line and elliott looks like it'll give tony a chance to play in all of them this year gosselin : the goal certainly is for him to play 16 games. if elliott can give this offense what demarco murray provided in 2014, i can see romo playing all 16 games. the cowboys took 100 passes off his plate in 2014 and he won his only nfl passing title and the cowboys finished 12-4. bob lilly is likely the most talented player ever drafted by the cowboys and played to the level of his talent. here are some highlights: question: do you see romo playing in all 16 games this season? that said, i'd cast my vote for staubach as the greatest cowboy of all time. the more the cowboys run the ball, the better the chance for his survival. i've always said, the less romo throws, the more i like him. who would you say is the greatest cowboy of all time??? question: saw you guys did a whole bunch of best of cowboys all time lists. (jae s. lee/the dallas morning news) rick gosselin recently held a chat to talk all things d-fw sports. gosselin : the most important position on the field is quarterback. but he's 36 this season, not 26. every time he gets hit, the dallas sideline will be holding its breath.
this is going to change with sun and moon and as reported by zheping huang in quartz, this is what we'll see: now nintendo wants to unify them: pokémon in greater china will be officially called 精靈寶可夢, or jingling baokemeng in mandarin (jingling means "spirit" or "elf," and baokemeng is a transliteration of pokémon). while the name 皮卡丘 in mandarin sounds similar to the global name pikachu (as it was always called in china and taiwan), it reads as pei-kaa-jau in cantonese, which doesn’t sound the same at all. this probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists. with nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland china, hong kong and taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified chinese. with nintendo's upcoming release of two new pokemon titles, pokemon sun and moon, i don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. because pokemon sun and moon will be translated into mandarin now, it's causing a stir because pikachu now has a new name! hong kong is where one of these twists can be found - hong kong being where the common language has always been cantonese, rather than mandarin. but when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. that's right, i said it, pikachu is now pikaqiu pikachu was originally translated as 比卡超 (bei-kaa-chyu) in hong kong. for some of you readers, pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering i played link-battles on the school bus with my friends. this may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though nintendo is sticking with the new translation. well, i guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. earlier in hong kong, it was 寵物小精靈 pet little elves (or spirits), while in taiwan, it was 神奇寶貝, magic babies. fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting nintendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from nintendo again. pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. pikachu just got a new name and people are p****d! now it is named 皮卡丘 (pikaqiu).

owen gaffney wrote in the new scientist, "for four billion years, the rate of change of the earth system (e) has been a complex function of astronomical (a) and geophysical (g) forces plus internal dynamics (i): earth’s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun’s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others." it shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries. "we are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence," steffen said. owen gaffney and will stephen of australian national university drew up the equation, which was published in the anthropocene review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of earth’s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet. however, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years "have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate". having said that, homo sapiens have now reached an era where if we fail to reduce the impact of our activities, then climate change could "trigger societal collapse", their research concluded. scientists have formulated a mathematical equation to project the mammoth effect homo sapiens are having on the planet and causing irreversible damage to the environment. he added, "in the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. steffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 0.01 degrees celsius per century. planet earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment’s most natural state of flux. "what we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. we’re now living in the anthropocene era - where human activity is the primary driver of change to the environment. "crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes. an equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet. according to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces. the impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet. all these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact." "the human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change." just in just in just in this is how humans are damaging #earth!
if it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around rasputin and the czarina—about whom there were prurient rumors, which rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to "the old girl"—but mgm couldn’t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles. a justice in the case told mgm that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events. it all started when an exiled russian prince sued mgm in 1933 over the studio’s rasputin biopic, claiming that the american production did not accurately depict rasputin’s murder. (the scene also libeled rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: "rasputin sucks," "rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses," etc.) in 1916, the fabulously wealthy, oxford-educated prince felix yusupov was one of several russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that rasputin—the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant—had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. unwisely, they’d prefaced the film with this: "this concerns the destruction of an empire ... a few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence." the strange reason nearly every film ends by saying it’s fiction virtually every film in modern memory ends with some variation of the same disclaimer: "this is a work of fiction. from that, audiences could logically infer that the yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the chegodieffs. but the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering natasha—by his logic, with which she agrees—unfit to be a wife. he argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin—in part because he’d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing rasputin. an mgm researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. the jake lamotta biopic raging bull credits lamotta as a consultant and cites his memoir as a source text just minutes before asserting that he is the film’s entirely fictional invention. mgm had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time. although the czarina was distraught, the czar let yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife irina. he wasn’t wrong: the new york times, in its review, noted that chegodieff was "really intended to represent [yusupov]." mgm was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. but having copped to being a murderer, yusupov couldn’t build much of a libel case. poster via wikimedia commons irina yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her £25,000, or about $125,000. lionel played rasputin, ethel the czarina, and john (grandfather of drew) was "prince paul chegodieff," a composite, who murders rasputin. yusupov contended that as viewers would equate chegodieff with yusupov, so would they link natasha with irina. for that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than grigori rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed romanovs. its big coup was casting the three barrymore siblings—stars of stage and silent film—in the lead roles. in the film, chegodieff’s wife is "princess natasha," a supporter of rasputin. but while yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, irina and rasputin had never met. a slate plus special feature: radio drama has returned to the spotlight—now what? in december, yusupov invited rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him. sixteen years later, mgm produced rasputin and the empress, based on those events. for decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality—even when it was patently untrue. instead, he alleged that rasputin and the empress in fact defamed his wife. (in doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.) the cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. and the prince ought to have known, having murdered him. any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental." yusupov, now penniless in paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. what proved to be mgm’s undoing was its lack of deniability. apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything. listen to this special slate plus bonus segment by joining – your first two weeks are free. the culture gabfest’s producer explains why radio drama isn’t dead. who knew its origins were so lurid? comedy central comedy central comedy central here’s the story.
to be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: an unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. as it turns out, dr. roger mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the telegraph: "i think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl." it’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. in the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. in some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move. as the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. "i suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask." "cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: it could represent the danger of a snake or another predator," mugford continued. a new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: for some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers. but the question remains: why on earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables? freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping. recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. why are cats so insanely afraid of cucumbers? well, there’s only one way to find out. get your model spiders at the ready. this is, after all, for science. cats are deeply curious creatures.
however, there is a set of the population (one that the american beverage association is trying to no doubt grow) that believes diet sodas are at least as effective, if not more so, than water in losing weight. the group drinking the water after their meals had a larger average weight loss than those who stuck with the diet beverages, and also improved the water group’s insulin resistance, the benefit of which could be leveraged in various medical treatments. a sample of 89 women who usually drank diet beverages, with bmis of 27-40 (slightly to moderately overweight), were parsed into two groups: those who would continue to drink diet beverages after eating their lunch and those who would replace their diet drinks with water. simply replace your diet soda with this after meals last year, some surprising news came from a study that suggested diet beverages were more effective in promoting weight loss than water was. this is among the first studies to offer a rebuttal to the aba-funded study, and it suggests, as many would believe, diet beverages do not beat water when it comes to losing weight. these results won’t be surprising to much of the population, especially as the positive effects of diet beverages is called more and more frequently into question against full-sugar drinks, never mind sugar- and calorie-free water. of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the american beverage association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies. however, a study conducted at the university of nottingham published earlier this month in the american journal of clinical nutrition offers some contradiction. due to the recency of those findings (they circulated in june 2014), the results haven’t been totally disproven. want to lose more weight? they did so five times per week for 24 weeks.
yet "captain phillips" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for hanks and greengrass (a previous nominee for "united 93," a film that bears similarities to "captain phillips" in structure and form), but for best editing (christopher rouse), best cinematography (barry ackroyd), best adapted screenplay (billy ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps best supporting actor for barkhad abdi. the problem is that abdi doesn't have an easy road to supporting actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like daniel bruhl (for "rush"), michael fassbender (for "12 years a slave"), josh brolin (for "labor day"), steve coogan (for "philomena"), bradley cooper (for "american hustle") and even hanks (for "saving mr. banks") potentially standing in his way. that hanks, a two-time best actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in paul greengrass' new film should provide oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances. his richard phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by catherine keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the history channel and likes tommy lee jones movies. heed the words from the former camp: "captain phillips" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with kathryn bigelow's "zero dark thirty" and well ahead of ben affleck's best picture-winning "argo." "captain phillips" is set to open the 2013 new york film festival, but sony and producer scott rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on toronto. tom hanks has the scene in "captain phillips," a moment that will play during the academy awards when jennifer lawrence announces hanks as a best actor nominee on march 2, 2014. this is the time of year when a new oscar front-runner debuts almost every day ("gravity" and "12 years a slave" reached the top of the line after raves last week). for now, just know that "captain phillips" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. abdi (and barkhad addirahman, faysal ahmed, mahat m. ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that greengrass deftly avoids. the reason is hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from tom hanks since the early 2000s. the newcomer plays muse, the lead somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. yet as greengrass keeps turning the screws on phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. hanks is put through the ringer -- greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (in contention editor kris tapley, huffpost entertainment's own mike ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (variety critic scott foundas, the wrap critic alonso duralde). by the end of the film, it's hard to tell where hanks ends and phillips begins. like the best acting, hanks' performance actually feels real. "captain phillips" opens on oct. 11. is this @tomhanks best performance ever? that, however, is back-room chatter for another day. it's riveting filmmaking.

but even if you don't have jumper cables, a tool kit, a tire-pressure gauge, and all the other stuff the gearheads say you should have on hand, there is one item that, in my book, is absolutely necessary. this almost free item is one of the most important things you can keep in your car you get a lot of advice about what you absolutely, positively must have in your car. best of all, this is an item that for most people will be 100% free, because rags are often headed to the garbage. you can also use it, if it isn't too filthy, to clean up spills in the interior and even to polish up the exterior. i myself was guilty of this for a time when, living in los angeles, i wanted to guard against the consequences of an earthquake by keeping a few gallons of water stashed in my minivan. you can use it to wipe stuff off of the engine so you can get a better look at fluid levels. you can use it to clean your headlights and taillights when winter gets them all grimy and slushy. you can use it to protect your hands when you have to loosen a stubborn lug nut. you don't really need a space blanket if you aren't planning a long trip through a desert or a frozen wasteland. so get yourself a good old rag and keep it in your vehicle. most of it is spot-on; some of it is a tad excessive. you can use it to wipe the dipstick when you check your oil. but everybody must have one in their car. you don't have to go that far. could be an old dishtowel or washcloth. could be an old t-shirt. because the rag can serve many purposes. some folks take their preparation to an extreme. you'll be glad you did. it's a rag. could be a bandana. yes, a humble rag. why?

850 dna matches after city clears rape kit backlog juan a. lozano, associated press houston (ap) — evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in houston have turned up 850 hits in the fbi's nationwide database of dna profiles, marking a major step in the city's $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced monday. experts say houston's backlog — and similar backlogs in other u.s. cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities. "this milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago," parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results. testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare dna profiles of possible suspects, mayor annise parker said. charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits — some of which dated back nearly three decades. more than 12,000 kits went untested for years in memphis, tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. "now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. in detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing. the ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible," she said. rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's dna. police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. in the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. harris county district attorney devon anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested. it's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years," parker said. one case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case. testing results are uploaded to the fbi's combined dna index system, or codis.

that's why the fact that some retailers — including bed bath & beyond, staples, chick-fil-a, and panera bread — don't have chip card readers up and running at all of their locations is a big concern. you see, if you swipe a chip card instead of inserting it into slot, the merchant is responsible for covering any fraudulent charges — not the bank. if you have a chip-enabled card, there's one thing you should never do you probably have a wallet full of credit cards with chips at this point. banks have been rolling them out like crazy and they're supposed to be safer — as long as you use them the right way, that is. some have even been waiting up to six months to get certified, even though the new system was supposed to be fully implemented by october 2015. and some retailers aren't in a financial position to cover major security breaches, like that corner store you picked up a gallon of milk from in a pinch. most popular however, retailers claim the readers must be certified by credit card companies to make sure they work before using. or if you do swipe, make sure you monitor your account closely to watch for fraudulent charges. either way, if you approach a check-out without a chip insert, just pay with cash instead.

today, elle has responded to the critics, defending its styling choices with the following statement: "on all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. vogue was hit with backlash in 2009 over an adele shoot that showed her sprawled nearly facedown on a bed, her shape obscured; vogue uk was faced with similar criticism over its adele cover in 2011, which zoomed in on the singer's face so closely it cropped out her neck. magazine responds to backlash against melissa mccarthy cover melissa mccarthy's elle cover, part of the magazine's women in hollywood cover series, features a striking gray winter coat, a voluminous woolen piece by marina rinaldi with a dramatic cut. when mccarthy's cover debuted last week, critics were quick to point out that the other november cover girls, including penelope cruz and reese witherspoon, were all styled in body-conscious outfits that flashed some skin. back then, instead of melissa mccarthy, gabourey sidibe was the curvy girl in the bunch; instead of penelope cruz and reese witherspoon, the other cover girls were megan fox, lauren conrad and amanda seyfried. then, just as they did today, the folks at elle denied any ill intent and said their choices for both photography and fashion styling were purely artistic. mccarthy, on the other hand, was dressed in a coat "so huge," wrote slate, "that she could hide her mike and molly co-star billy gardel underneath." the latter three were photographed from the knees up, showing off their full outfits, while sidibe's cover photo was cropped at her chest. fashion magazines have long been accused of treating their curvier cover models differently than their stick-thin celeb cover girls. in fact, elle faced similar accusations in 2010 with another series of covers. we are thrilled to honor her as one of our women in hollywood this year." but the fashionable garment isn't having quite the impact the editors likely anticipated. do you agree?
here's what happens if you never wash your jeans © provided by the independent the argument for not washing your jeans has traditionally been about making your denim last longer -- hot water and detergent can speed up how quickly your jeans fade. bacteria, skin cells, and sweat are transferred to our pants from our own body but "skin microorganisms are generally not hazardous to ourselves," said rachel mcqueen, a professor of human ecology at the university of alberta in canada. there is no evidence that not washing jeans is hazardous to your health, according to bernhard redl, an associate professor in the molecular biology department at the university of innsbruck in austria. the student-teacher team was surprised to find that the unwashed jeans carried nearly the same amount of bacteria as those same pants after they had been washed and then worn for another 13 days. denim-heads have suggested freezing your jeans as a way to kill bacteria and the stench, although there is no scientific proof that this method is effective. "i think airing your jeans outdoors in the sunlight would be a more effective method of getting rid of odors and a lot of bacteria," said mcqueen. bacteria stops growing in the freezer, but will become active again once you slip your pants back on and those germs are warmed up by the heat of your body. but apart from smelling, microbiologists say there is nothing to worry about from a health perspective if you never wash your jeans. a few years ago, one of mcqueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them. "if you talk to real denim aficionados, they tell you don't wash your blue jeans," bergh said in a 2014 interview at fortune magazine's brainstorm green conference. the freezing myth although not washing your jeans doesn't seem to pose any health risks, the smell could become a problem. "it is clear that freezing does not kill most of the bacteria," said redl, "but puts them in a dormant state." levi's ceo chip bergh says we should stop washing our jeans because it's good for the environment since it saves water and energy. however, "sanitizing your hands is going to be a more important issue here than washing your jeans," she said. that would be true in a hospital, for example, where clothing can transfer infections. "there are environments where having sterile clothing is important," mcqueen said. this generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear. "what i found was just normal skin flora," mcqueen told the national post in 2011. mcqueen's research focuses on the development and retention of odors in textiles. the bacteria load from the swabbed areas were pretty much the same." is not washing your jeans safe? this advice may seem cringeworthy. "the counts were really, really similar.

rubbing these two things on your teeth will make them whiter in minutes now it's no secret that there are a slew of unusual ways to whiten teeth, but the pearly-white-yielding concoction that this desi blogger, farah dhukai, uses is slightly less jarring and just as effective for a whiter smile within minutes. she simply combines one tablespoon of coconut oil with a pinch of turmeric to create a paste, brushes her teeth with the blend, lets it sit on her teeth for five minutes, then rinses it off for an instantly brighter grin. here's the thing, you won't see a drastic difference the first time you try it. but as opposed to harsh bleaches you'll find in over-the-counter treatments, its natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties make it super healthy for your oral health, much like it is for the skin. the idea is that if you get into the habit of doing this a few times a week, it will—like white strips—work gradually over time. most popular here's the thing, you won't see a drastic difference the first time you try it. this is because turmeric, an ancient medicinal herb, helps removes plaque (some that's not evident to the naked eye), which causes discoloration. 's other ingredient—coconut oil—works similarly to wash out stains. but be forewarned, this method will turn your toothbrush yellow. in fact, research has found that it can help prevent dental disease. and this d.i.y.
good news: recent studies have shown that knocking back a cold glass of milk could be the answer to all of your pee-related struggles. it’s chock-full of nutrients and electrolytes like potassium, which not only keep you hydrated but also take longer for your body to process so you buy some time between bathroom breaks. why you should drink milk before a road trip anyone who has a small bladder knows to think twice before downing a big gulp during a road trip. traffic jams, questionably hygienic rest stop bathrooms or, worse, miles of open road with no civilization in sight are all high-risk situations. so instead, you find yourself dehydrated, which also sucks. just sip on one percent or skim if you’re worried about the cals. good news, there is a solution. why?

the national safety council has some advice for how to safely shovel snow: do not shovel after eating or while smoking take it slow and stretch out before you begin push the snow rather than lifting it if you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel lift with your legs, not your back do not work to the point of exhaustion talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest do not shovel after eating or while smoking take it slow and stretch out before you begin push the snow rather than lifting it if you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel lift with your legs, not your back do not work to the point of exhaustion talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest do not shovel after eating or while smoking take it slow and stretch out before you begin push the snow rather than lifting it if you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel lift with your legs, not your back do not work to the point of exhaustion talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest eight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day. read this before you go out to shovel your driveway men are more likely to have a heart attack after a snowfall, and it's probably from the exertion of shoveling snow, canadian researchers reported monday. a single day of snowfall raised a man's risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent. women were not more likely to either have heart attacks or to die of them after snow, the team found. people using snow blowers have also been reported to have higher rates of heart attack, the canadian team noted. using the arms intensively and repetitively, especially while standing upright, can also raise the risk that a piece will break off from a clogged artery, the researchers noted. people often exhale hard with their mouths closed while lifting a heavy shovel full of snow, a dangerous habit called the valsalva maneuver, they noted. snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads," they added. "we suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack)," dr. nathalie auger of the university of montreal hospital research center and colleagues wrote. they found a slight increase in both heart attacks and deaths from heart attack in quebec after a storm. "men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. it's not a daily activity, and it strains the heart, auger's team said. the likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the canadian medical association journal. the team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died. it might not only be shoveling that does it. snow shoveling is hard. cold temperatures make blood vessels constrict, which adds to the danger.
but the most powerful photo in the series is one of little aubrey wrapped in motorcycle gloves, next to a colorful, shiny motorcycle helmet. when photographer kim stone shot the recently born aubrey in a series of darling setups, she posed her in soft pink sheets and beautiful blue headwear, like these photogenic triplets. though her life began with a bit of strife, aubrey’s sweet smile emulates hope for her family. but watch what they capture on camera... there’s something about seeing a little newborn preciously posed with clothing, keepsakes, or other familial props that really makes their announcement into the world a celebration. this image is particularly touching because it is representative of her father, whose life was tragically cut short several weeks before her birth. the hands gently curl around the child while she grins peacefully, safe under the guise of big, strong arms. her daddy died before she was born.

a bill in the state house of representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state commissioner of health. cloud times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions. while such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure. minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the white house every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, politics in minnesota reported earlier this month. police agencies won't let it minnesota will consider passing legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana, but police agencies are standing in the way. this time around, governor mark dayton (d) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of minnesota law enforcement agencies. the head of one police agency put it another way: he openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars. patients would first need to obtain an id card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure hf 1818, which was introduced by rep. carly melin (d-hibbing) last spring. as a result, melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form. minnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms. a similar effort was approved by the minnesota house and senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-governor tim pawlenty (r). "but we’re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there’s going to have to be compromise." hf 1818 has been referred to the health and human services policy committee and is scheduled to have a hearing wednesday evening. there's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. so far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. cloud state university poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue. melin said her compromise bill could be ready as soon as next week. "obviously any compromise ... [is] disheartening for patients," melin told the la crosse tribune. a st. their opposition, according to a report in local paper st. this state wants to legalize medical marijuana.
likewise, young boys (and girls, i might add) must learn the hard way that mistakes like forgetting lunch or homework at home lead to likewise, young boys (and girls, i might add)mustlearn the hard way that mistakes like forgetting lunch or homework at home lead to tangible consequences but by experiencing these sometimes painful consequences, the young men at the catholic high schools for boys will be that much more inspired to ensure that they never make the same mistake again. parents who bring forgotten lunch to school see shocking orders posted on door the catholic high schools for boys in little rock, arkansas, deserves a raucous round of applause, because its educators clearly known the meaning of the catholic high schools for boys in little rock, arkansas, deserves a raucous round of applause, because its educators clearly known the meaning of personal responsibility and achievement. forgetting to turn off the stove or pick up a son or daughter from school, on the other hand, is much more costly — which is why training young boys early to avoid mistakes by thinking ahead is worthy of praise. namely, the sign educators at the school posted for parents attempting to drop off any items that their son may have forgotten to take with him that morning. take a look: posted wednesday on posted wednesday on facebook , the sign had by thursday morning already received almost 10,000 likes and 7,000 shares from parents who appreciated the educators’ impressive wisdom. "if you are dropping off your son’s forgotten lunch, books, homework, equipment, etc., please turn around and exit the building," the sign read. "this is all about teaching young men (high schoolers are not children) to become responsible adult men and spouses and fathers through allowing ‘soft failures,'" one parent, margaret barsocchi willis, wrote. moreover, forgetting lunch or homework at home is a relatively minor mistake with hardly troubling repercussions. we all make mistakes, but unless we learn from them, the likelihood of us repeating them remains pretty high. "your son will learn to problem-solve in your absence." what makes me believe this?
if you play when it’s laggy, then the person you’re playing with will experience the same lag, so it’s best to play when the connection is clear. during our 3rd match during for fun while playing online using our home wifi network, smash bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). (wordpress) the part where i complain about the 3ds hardware something tells me the new 3ds was made because the current one can't handle super smash bros. (smash bros) ssb4 online lag fixes and placebos having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like super smash bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. (smash bros) super smash bros 4 lag: online multiplayer we began our testing using both the for fun and for glory modes on the 3ds. during multi-player, you’re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it’s due to the connection speed. having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the wii u -- in hd and with gamecube controllers in hand. during development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. we got a hint of this when we did our review for ssb43ds but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in japan. how to fix lag in ssb4 on 3ds there's no denying that super smash bros 4 on the 3ds is a great game. i and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing super smash bros 4. the game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our smash bros 4 fights always take place in lag city. if nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of super smash bros 4, fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company. nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. this is the first time a smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . 5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lw2pqns — raymond lancione (@raylancione) october 7, 2014 if anyone's having #smashbros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. if you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free. the 3ds charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. we're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. but nothing's perfect -- in the case of smash bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. the most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd cpu player was thrown in the mix. the sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying. though all in all, smash players now that the 3ds version isn't the real experience. (smash bros) ssb4: local multiplayer playing smash with our bros in person was a different story. now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. (@miluette) october 6, 2014 "connectivity can depend heavily on location so i really don’t know what to say. in a 2nd round of local smash bros 4 multiplayer "testing" (read: playing in the office, for science!) at the very least, we’ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. for some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. similar to when i played sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. the fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. without the ability to hit the home button we were forced to turn it off. despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds. (not that you could ever seriously play smash on a smartphone, but not the point). in a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. are you experiencing lag in your online battles in smash bros 4? but what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? the release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. we played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. it’s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. whether it be local multiplayer in sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often. during our for fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. the same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon smash session. despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. so guys, found out i had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 cpus resulted in no lag. (smash bros) for glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. could the ice climbers have part of smash bros for the iphone ? though similar to for fun, the lag was consistent. now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with louis ck . not to mention og 3ds owners not getting access to the beloved c-stick. 2 players was much easier on the system. not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable. would the ps vita have these lag issues? on to for glory then. let us know your experiences below! free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either." boy were we wrong. — it was me, milu! so, we quantified it. but smash is serious business.

19 things you’ll only get if you’re low and high maintenance you like the best of things but you can easily compromise. but if you’re in a situation where it would be rude or not possible to ask for modifications, you’ll just eat what you’re given. when you order something to eat or drink, you’re not afraid to ask for it to be made to your exact specifications. so depending on which one you’re feeling, it could either take you a few minutes or a few hours to get ready. you know exactly what you like to drink and won’t order anything else, even if it’s cheaper. when it comes to food, you won’t just eat any old thing. but you’ll never throw a strop if people don’t feel the same. basically, you like the best of things, but you can easily compromise. because your standards are pretty high, people expect the best from you at all times. even though you tend to just rotate the same few outfits when you get there. it’s their funeral if they don’t want to take on your ideas. most of the time you believe that your way is the best way. i'll prob change a few times a day so thats...32 shirts 10. but you can’t be fussed with any routine that’s more than three steps. when it comes to your appearance, you generally have two looks. [normal life] ive worn the same shirt everyday for a week [packing for vacation] hmmm. which can be an exhausting pressure because you’re actually quite lazy. because you’re partial to fancy hipster foods, like expensive artisanal bread. however, you’ll happily skimp on other items to afford your luxurious foodie lifestyle. you always overpack your suitcase when you go away. you’re medium-maintenance. it’s all about balance, after all. because you, my friend, have very little patience. your beauty products are almost exclusively high-end. 19. but no glasses? 5. no problem! 2. 1. 4. 18. 3. 13. 12. 17. 7. 8. 9. 16. 15. 14. 11. 6.
state senators want to make it easier to legislate behind closed doors washington -- arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the state's requirements for open meetings make it too difficult for them to do their jobs. "it's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier," begay said. state sen. carlyle begay (d), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told the huffington post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. "we're all held to a certain standard and i think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that," he said. "our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible." "it allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is," barr told the huffington post. the plan, proposed by state sen. sylvia allen (r), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. "right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues." that process, allen told the arizona daily sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws. in fact, allen told the arizona daily sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. dan barr, a first amendment lawyer with the firm perkins coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input. arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action. because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. begay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss "unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors." barr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult. that can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, begay said. "efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy," barr told the huffington post. "staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable," allen told the daily sun. "it allows people then to participate in that."
the real reason airplane windows don't always align with your seat have you ever had to crane your neck just to glimpse a sliver of skyline from the airplane window right next to your seat? it turns out that airplanes are designed with general row positioning and spacing recommendations that align with the airplane windows. and the resulting misalignment has to do how they tinker with seat size and seat pitch. well, there’s a reason your airplane seat is woefully misaligned with the windows. and it has everything to do with the airline greed. watch the video above to learn why your seat isn’t where it should be. it’s frustrating when your window seat offers more wall than window. however, airlines rarely follow those recommendations. vlogger simon whistler tackled this issue on the "today i found out" youtube channel.
groening has actually said in the past that the springfield in the show was named after springfield, oregon, but didn’t go so far as to admit "street names and locations" were, as well. the homepage of the official website for the oregonian city even claims, "yes, this is the ‘real’ springfield from ‘the simpsons.’" of course, even if this is true, jean and groening will likely never fully admit it. the only reason is that when i was a kid, the tv show "father knows best" took place in the town of springfield, and i was thrilled because i imagined that it was the town next to portland, my hometown. here's a new clue about where 'the simpsons' actually takes place if you still have any energy left after waiting for an answer over the course of all these years, begin to ! jean began his answer by saying the team behind "the simpsons" could never actually reveal that, but then continued with a hint that was more or less an admission. so by this point, with "the simpsons" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real springfield is could be noteworthy. "i would say just judging by the street names and locations, it’s closer to springfield, oregon, where matt groening is from, than any other springfield," said jean. jean continued his answer about springfield, oregon, during the press conference by saying, "but the great thing about [the show’s city] is it’s universal. this article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both groening and jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. further trying to dispel that groening revealed the location, jean reminded tv guide readers that "the simpsons movie" hinted that the town’s true whereabouts are geographically impossible. the town name is extremely popular in this country and the family’s creator, matt groening, has never quite revealed its true location. here’s part of the piece that gets into the oregon connection: ok, why do the simpsons live in a town called springfield? here’s a walkthrough of universal studios’ recreation of springfield: here’s a walkthrough of universal studios’ recreation of springfield: here’s a walkthrough of universal studios’ recreation of springfield: the show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where bart simpson repeatedly wrote, "the true location of springfield is in any state but yours." jean continued, "he was inspired by growing up in portland, but it’s really an every town. during a press conference call promoting the series’ new season that began last sunday, a reporter from mynewyorkeye bluntly asked executive producer al jean, "where is springfield? in 2012, smithsonian magazine titled a piece in 2012, smithsonian magazine titled a piece "matt groening reveals the location of the real springfield." i also figured out that springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the u.s. whenever people say it’s springfield, ohio, or springfield, massachusetts, or springfield, wherever, i always go, "yup, that’s right." in anticipation of the success of the show, i thought, "this will be cool; everyone will think it’s their springfield." jean told jean told tv guide at the time that smithsonian magazine "misinterpreted something [he has] heard [groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years." in a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to oregon. "in the movie we say [springfield] borders on ohio, nevada, maine and kentucky," said jean. matt grew up in oregon and parts of ‘the simpsons’ were definitely inspired by his childhood. but there is no specific state that springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret." the city of portland, oregon, was named after the city of portland, maine. but despite millions of fellow americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their "springfield" actually is. the simpson family has resided in the american town of springfield for nearly three decades. you’ve never said it was named after springfield, oregon, before, have you? when i grew up, i realized it was just a fictitious name. for what it’s worth, ohio has a city named oregon. i don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? and there is an unincorporated community that calls itself "oregon" in kentucky. when you do, you’re a true ‘simpsons’ fan." i grew up in michigan, and i can totally relate to it. do you want to tell which state springfield is in?" anybody, wherever you’re from, has a springfield near them." the people of oregon are just especially close. the state of oregon does border nevada. springfield was named after springfield, oregon. "the simpsons" springfield = springfield, oregon. it’s really funny. isn’t that a little generic? "so good luck finding that state. and they do. !!!!!!!! !
a pregnant dog lays lifelessly in a field, but seconds later, i gasped the first time they went to check on a stray dog named norah, the folks at take me home pet rescue feared she’d be dead. this remarkable story reminds me of hero, the abandoned dog who led passersby to a litter of ten sick, newborn puppies and their exhausted mother rekka fostered norah and her puppies in conjunction with take me home pet rescue. once the entire family was back at the rescue, norah continued to nurse and bond with her babies – only now, they had a warm, safe environment and were off the streets for good. she’s gained weight and seems to be feeling good and she likes to run around and chase and play tug-of-war with her puppies. much to their surprise, norah picked her head up as she lay on the side of the highway, all alone. she shared an update of this precious canine family, saying, "she was in rough shape when we got her and was skin and bone. that’s right – of all the nearby places, norah and her pups took refuge at the united house of prayer. she’d been hiding them in the courtyard of a nearby church, safe inside the shrubs and bushes. they realized she looked a lot thinner than usual, and were shocked to learn that norah had been pregnant! the team would watch with baited breath as norah crossed the busy texas highways, back and forth, walking the streets. just a few days before her rescue, norah had given birth to nine tiny puppies! what a fantastic example of the power of dog rescue. finally, after several weeks of trying to trap norah, they succeeded. she is such an amazing dog!" norah was notoriously elusive, and wouldn’t let humans near.
here’s sony’s response to microsoft’s invite to connect xbox one and ps4 networks here’s sony’s response to microsoft’s invite to connect xbox one and ps4 networks microsoft finally announced cross-network play for xbox one. speaking to gamespot, sony confirmed that the company was not against cross-console support and open to the idea of allowing playstation 4 players to play online against other consoles. sony has now issued a response to microsoft’s invitation for utilizing this feature that might allow gamers from both the consoles to play against each other online. the first game to make use of microsoft’s cross-network features would be rocket league, that’ll allow xbox one and pc players to compete against each other. read sony’s response on the next page read sony’s response on the next page read sony’s response on the next page interestingly, the ps4 version of the game already has this feature implemented, allowing steam users to compete against ps4 players. this allows the xbox one players to play online with gamers who own other devices. however, it was smart enough not to confirm a deal with microsoft yet. could this mean sony might do the same with xbox one? it could be anything ranging from a pc to another console. we all know when they say "console" what comes to mind: the playstation 4. well, sony just issued a statement that might give us an idea about its future plans. an elusive feature that gamers have been wanting for years.

the end is not near, as a ‘near earth pass’ isn’t actually that near at all – in fact, the asteroid is going to go past the earth 7.3 million miles away (that’s 30 times further away than the moon), reports the daily star. pexels however, don’t stop panicking completely just yet, as nasa has also confirmed that a much smaller asteroid is heading towards earth at a speed of 31,000 mph. the smaller space rock, known as ql44, is 61-metres long and is expected to hit the earth or narrowly miss it on september 17 – however, nasa have claimed they are very ‘uncertain’ about its flight path. nasa has just confirmed that a gargantuan mile-long asteroid is heading towards earth and will brush past us in just a matter of hours. fortunately, if these asteroids don’t completely devastate the earth then the apocalypse will annihilate us next year anyhow – or at least that’s what this radical group believes. scientists have claimed that the rock, known as 2004 bo41, will have a ‘near earth pass’ later this afternoon. experts have claimed that if this meteor was to hit a city the size of london it would have an impact as destructive as several nuclear bombs. it is known as a near earth pass simply because of how terrifyingly large the universe is. pixabay asteroids are being discovered by scientists more and more every day, but alarmingly, only 10 per cent of them actually get spotted. nasa warns massive asteroid is heading towards earth today flickr panic panic panic panic panic. why is nasa choosing to terrify us all today? but don’t stress too much.
a woman who interviewed over 100 people at goldman sachs says there's one question she always hoped candidates would ask her, but they never did at some point toward the end of every job interview, the hiring manager will likely turn the tables and ask, "do you have any questions for me?" she continues: i think this is a good question for interviewees to ask because, as a candidate, if you see where the person interviewing you is headed, you can decide if that trajectory is in line with your career objectives. before launching her own business, brown, who has a bachelor's from harvard university and an mba from columbia, spent a lot of time interviewing job candidates at goldman sachs, where she held various roles, including analyst, wealth adviser, and chief of staff. "it's an important question for anyone to be asking him or herself, and so if ever a candidate were to ask this question, it would have stood out." this is the time to ask smart, thoughtful questions — perhaps your final opportunity to assess whether the job would be a good fit, and your final chance to impress the hiring manager. "i interviewed anywhere from 20 to 30 job candidates a year, so in total, i interviewed over 100 people at goldman sachs," she tells business insider. — but there was one question she always hoped she'd be asked, but almost never was: "where do you see yourself in five years?" she says that candidates asked her some impressive questions — like "what's the most challenging part of your job?" while they don't have to be completely correlated, it's helpful for the candidate to have some indication of the interviewer's direction. "i like this question — and yet no one ever asked it — because it's difficult to answer," she says. business insider recently spoke with becca brown, cofounder of solemates, a brand of women's shoe-care products, who knows a thing or two about interviewing. she was also part of the investment bank's harvard recruiting team, she says. and "what's one of the most interesting projects you've worked on?" get the latest goldman sachs stock price here.

watch: wrestling legend comes out of the closet at 73 as tmz first reported, the 73-year-old wrestling icon spoke at length about his sexuality for the first time publicly in a clip from the reality series, "legends' house." as the bleacher report pointed out, however, the canadian-born patterson's announcement was actually taped in 2012, but didn't become public until thursday, june 12, when the season finale aired. fortunately, the response patterson then receives from his "legends' house" cast mates is truly heartwarming. "for once in my life, i'm gonna be me now," a teary-eyed patterson says. meanwhile, wwe commentator jim ross suggested that patterson's declaration came as no surprise to wrestling industry insiders. "i survived all this, being gay ... i lived with that for 50-something years."
‘i wasn’t saying that just quoting somebody else.’ when you have the white house press secretary quote somebody to prove a point, you’re endorsing that view." it’s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bullshit doesn’t work because look at results. zakaria said, "i think the president is somewhat indifferent to things that are true or false. he sees something he doesn’t particularly care if it’s true or not. [warning: adult language] friday on "cnn tonight," network host fareed zakaria said president donald trump has succeeded by "bullshitting." notice again at the press conference, when pushed on it, does take responsibility. hey, what's that thing *you* did to succeed? he has gotten the presidency by bullshitting. just puts it out there and then he puts something else out. but that’s what he does. he has succeeded by bullshitting. he has spent his whole life bullshitting. right?

it's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. in both the books and the films, the patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness. rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for hagrid, who was expelled from hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. when a fan asked rowling what form hagrid's patronus would take – a great question, considering hagrid's unusual taste in pets – she replied : "hagrid couldn't produce a patronus. but fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a patronus. the charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity. j.k. rowling has revealed a heartbreaking truth about hagrid during a q&a on twitter, j.k. rowling made a surprising revelation about rubeus hagrid, one of the best-loved characters from the harry potter series. it's a very difficult spell." oh, hagrid!

for example, condom use didn’t seem to affect the time, and neither did men’s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack. the best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch. this means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it. before you say, because it’s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn’t care about fun per se – it generally only "designs" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. it didn’t much matter which country the couples came from either – unless they came from turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (netherlands, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states). the company launched fleshlight launchpad, which allows users of their flashlight-shaped, vagina-like toy to plug it into the back of an ipad in order to 'fully immerse themselves' in whatever they're watching. the user dons an oculus rift to enter the virtual world populated by an anime character, he can then squeeze a novelty mouse pad with foam breasts with pressure sensors inside them. what this suggests is that men’s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men’s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. i know there’s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well. one is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it’s socially desirable to say you go long into the night. in 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina. well, your problems will be solved with the lovely - a sex toy that's been touted as 'the fitbit, but for your penis'. for example, even though we like eating food, we don’t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. sex isn’t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making. if you’re a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex "normally" last? as an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: why does it last any time at all? the average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. that’s right, the guy who made this didn’t even want to fabricate a positive sexual experience – instead he went for virtual abuse. exhibit a: a ‘game’ which lets users squeeze a virtual woman’s breasts who responds by squealing in disgust and covering up her chest. the nightmarish love child of an endoscopy and a vibrator, the 'svakom gaga camera vibrator' allows for a new level of explicitness in amateur sex tapes. it's a question man has been asking ever since it discovered it was useful in certain situations for procreation thousands of years ago. another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men). a scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: what is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time? "every day, millions of hours of adult content are consumed online, wasting energy in the process and hurting the environment," the porn site writes on a dedicated website. the other problem is that people don’t necessarily know how long they go for. by brendan zietsch, research fellow at the university of queensland this article was originally published in the conversation . read the original version here this article was originally published in the conversation . introducing the wankband: the first wearable tech that allows you to love the planet by loving yourself." the band creates power when moved in an up and down motion, with a kinetic charger inside storing the clean (albeit slightly dirty) energy generated. all sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. you may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. that is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed "start" at penile penetration and "stop" at ejaculation. what about just asking people how long they take, you say? my advice would be to try not to think about it during the throes of passion. the lovely is a stretchy silicone ring, which attaches around the base of your penis. to keep things simple and specific, we’ll just focus on the time to ejaculation. the average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. but now it has reached an absurd and mildly dystopian conclusion: 3d-printed d*ck pics. that would be inefficient, and so we’ve evolved to find it gross. measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. the most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. but – science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we’ve got. "at pornhub we decided to do something about it. why do we have sex for so long? it also has a vibrator tucked inside, which stimulates both sexual partners. by pointing it at *any* object and capturing it three-dimensionally. well, there are two main problems with this. how long does sex normally last? so what did the researchers find? so what to do with this information? the set-up works like this. why all the thrusting and bumping? what does the research say? read the original version here a handheld 3d scanner such as fuel3d's scanify above. there were some interesting secondary results, too. that’s an 80-fold difference. the means? the reason? the method? grinding?). rubbing?
rudy's very much of an expert on cyber security: it's been a very important thing to him, and to what he does and maybe i'll ask rudy to say a few words. when the guy on his right (homeland security chief general john kelly) clearly took pity on him and pointed out the obvious, trump proceeded to swing his big wig back to the left and say:  oh there's rudy. but then the above video happened... with that i wanna introduce rudy giuliani and he's gonna be working with jared kushner and with tom bossert who are also here. during a briefing in the white house on cybersecurity, trump introduced the man he's chosen to fight the war on hacking: former new york city mayor rudy giuliani. it's because he could not locate the guy sitting right in front of him. then he looks around desperately to his left and right, saying: where's rudy? people are very worried by this video of donald trump some twitter users are joking about president donald trump's mental state again. and no, that's not because of his casual disregard for fact, or his utterly incomprehensible incoherence. a few 'haters and losers' on twitter have inevitably kicked off with the cracks. he says this sitting across the table from rudy, directly facing him. however, lucidity didn't seem to return to his eyes (relatively speaking) until a few seconds after giuliani began talking.
for an immunologist fantastic voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked one, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. in an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. in doing so he developed, together with georges köhler in 1975, a method that made b cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. scientists showed that god was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of dna in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of dna sequences the difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. the film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when raquel welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her. this led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. and as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. the antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find god in the classic 1966 science fiction film, fantastic voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. he could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. the god problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted nobel prizes . they have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . but there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible. the instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time nobel prize winner linus pauling , while macfarlane burnet (also a nobel prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . the makers of the film followed pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. the antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. this led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. perhaps most notably césar milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. the alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. the god problem in several in the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. these newly cloned b cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. each b cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. when a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one b cell will recognise it. and some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. he wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate b cells to make antibodies. the impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. in economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of us$75 billion in 2013. in the 1930s karl landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally. scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. they often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. that b cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. it was termed the "generation of diversity", or god problem. this would require billions of different antibodies. however, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument. applications that could save millions of lives.
meadows in the mountains – bulgaria situated in the rhodope mountains, this festival is not interested in a-list line-ups but rather providing a means for escapism, with attendees revelling in the wildlife and fauna that covers the site and erecting stages, timber shacks and art installations out wood sustainably sourced from the surrounding forests. "afrikaburn - tankwa karoo electric forest - rothbury, michigan it's hard to think of a festival more picturesque than this one, which takes place in a dense forest that is lit with neon so as to give it an otherworldly look. here we round up some global options when it comes to festivals you really have to commit to: boom – portugal taking place every two years beside a lake, boom celebrates the full moon with a psychedelic maelstrom of events encouraging people to converge and experience an alternative reality. the emphasis here is on art, with the tall trees being utilised to create some stunning installations and nooks, but there is also a packed dj line-up each year and an enormous stage. after a while of walking around in the dark she comes upon what looks like this portable toilet out in the middle of nowhere. 6 transcendental festivals out in the middle of nowhere some festivals are about music some are about food or culture some are about just blowing off some steam built up at work or while studying. surrounded by rocky mountains in the scorched spanish desert, this festival is so intense it's website comes with not only a survival guide but an 'emotional survival guide'. envision - costa rica if the lush rainforest of uvita isn't enough for you, at sunset the tropical beach of playa hermosa opens at this festival, which is all about exploring our fundamental connection with nature. you already know the main details, so here's an anecdote that perfectly sums it up: "[my friend] decided to wander out onto the playa one night for a little alone time. they're easy to scoff at, but while cynics are sat at their desks mocking people trying to "find themselves", thousands are having legitimately moving and profound experiences that might actually make them reassess how they choose to live their everyday life. art, spirituality, yoga, music, dance, performance, education and sustainability are the cornerstones of envision, which is filled with temples and healing sanctuaries. she stayed there for a while, had a couple of drinks, thanked the bartender and then walked back to her camp. the holy grail though tends to be the ones aiming for a deeper experience, that reject the isolation of modern society and cherish togetherness. all styles of music can be found but the emphasis is on the electronic, along with talks, group meditation and film screenings. he smiles at her and says, "welcome to the smallest bar in the world, what you like?" with community building, decommodification, creativity, self-reliance and radical self-expression as its core values, afrikaburn is a vast in scale, week-long experience involving a ton of performances. afrikaburn - tankwa karoo this is not so much a festival as a temporary city. she thinks to herself, "i could pee right now," walks over to the porta potty and opens the door. it claims to be "an autonomous zone of cognitive liberty" and therefore is completely free from corporate sponsorship and logos. also, it throws a pool party for everyone the day after the festival ends. instead there's a guy standing behind a wooden bar top with shelves of liquor behind him. after the initial shock wore off, she steps inside and orders a shot of whiskey. nowhere – spain finally, we come to the appropriately named nowhere. only it's not a toilet. this year's theme is simply 'play'. burning man - black rock desert the mecca of transformational festivals.
witherly concludes in "why humans like junk food" that the key to kfc's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and msg with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness. piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets. the nephew, joe ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub. "one of the theories i've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again," witherly says. kfc’s secret ingredient is 'the most under-appreciated spice' in the world colonel sanders' nephew recently revealed what he claims is the secret recipe for kfc chicken. "i've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system," witherly said. cooks illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. kfc's alleged secret recipe is as follows: 2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. white pepper as great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. food scientist dr. steven witherly, author of "why humans like junk food," was taken aback when he saw the recipe. the famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper. white pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. the upshot, according to witherly, is that it could make kfc more addicting. but he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense. white pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. although kfc has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. "the main ingredient is white pepper," ledington told the chicago tribune. and that's why 12 million people eat kfc every day. "i call that the secret ingredient. nobody knew what white pepper was. nobody knew how to use it" in the 1950s. interestingly, google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade. salt 1/2 tbsp. black pepper 1 tbsp. he says was his first reaction. thyme 1/2 tbsp.

it wasn’t the first time i’d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners’ self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. it’s no secret that more americans are having anal sex than ever before: a study published last year in the journal of sexual medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. i’ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys i’ve actually heard use the irritating i’m-not-gay qualifier "no homo" (as in, "i like your shirt — no homo") — before i wallop them over the head. as carol queen joked, "i wish i had a nickel for every time i’ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person’s sexual orientation." i’ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women’s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it. sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot i was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex. charlie glickman, a good vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed "more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before." his colleague carol queen, a staff sexologist, says, "lots of guys don’t talk about [it], but do it anyway," and "plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes." then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that r&b singer usher’s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). as debby herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the kinsey institute, told me: "there is no good national-level data on this topic." tristan taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the "expert guide to anal pleasure for men," has noticed that guys are increasingly "feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies" in this area. they haven’t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they’ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. for my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before — just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. in the years after her educational x-rated video "bend over boyfriend" premiered in 1998, it was the shop’s best-selling tape, and the top rental. a female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: "yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt." the perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let’s call him freddy, announced something to the effect of, "having your prostate milked is awesome." another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as "a gay thing" has been somewhat lessened. it’s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. but that survey didn’t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation. without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. the phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. for perhaps the first time in my life, i felt like a sexual square. in 2001, popular sex columnist dan savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. the winner was "peg" (the runner-up was "bob," as in "bend over boyfriend"). i set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. someone else chimed in: "it’s the male g-spot." but i live in san francisco; my sample is skewed. i nearly choked on my beer. another head nodded. well, then.
things in the olsen twins' lives that make no sense it kind of goes without saying that any hope for a normal life gets dashed for people who become millionaires before they can even walk, but mary-kate and ashley olsen, who famously portrayed michelle tanner on the smash sitcom full house, cranked the dial on their wacky personal lives all the way up to 11. the good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life. according to a 2016 story in the huffington post, the venue mostly features paintings of paparazzi photos of mary-kate and ashley hiding their faces, but it also has other wacky features like "a phone that only takes calls from candace cameron bure offering parts on fuller house" and a recreation of mary-kate's wedding tablescape of cigarettes. there's definitely a tongue-in-cheek aspect to the attraction, which is why the curators have also published a companion magazine, which is basically just photos of the paintings with funny captions: "here we see an olsen coming to one of two realizations: that she will have to close a car door herself (for some reason) or that her outfit only works sitting down." the ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply. while it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury. alexa, tell the olsen twins they sound like snobs in a profile in the new york times about the launch of the row — the olsen twins' super high-end clothing store, ashley admitted she "has never purchased anything online," while mary-kate bought something once "at an online auction." fuller house remains one pair shy portraying michelle tanner on full house was undeniably the starting point for all of the olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, fuller house, the olsen twins were the only ones to decline. according to show producer bob boyett, "ashley said, 'i have not been in front of a camera since i was 17, and i don't feel comfortable acting,'" and "mary-kate said, it would have to be me because ash doesn't want to do it. page six reported that a source said there were "bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes, and everyone smoked the whole night," which is bizarre, especially since it took place in manhattan, where for years smokers have been shunned into shameful, huddled groups as far away from the general public as possible. there's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar mary-kate and ashley's lives have become. are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the olsen twins just trying to give gwyneth paltrow and her annual goop gift guide — with its similarly market-priced personal submarine — a run for its money? their most famous film, new york minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on rotten tomatoes – and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star eugene levy — yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. the times story includes the following descriptions about their boutique: "they convinced masa takayama, the renowned sushi chef, to sell them his ceramics," and "indeed, the store feels more like a tastefully appointed manse than a traditional retail shop, its individual rooms decorated with marquee art (a basquiat here, a borge jorgensen sculpture there) and significant furniture." mary-kate looks...different for most of their adult lives, the olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of cameron diaz, but around november 2014, people began noticing just how different mary-kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. with everything from their strange dating preferences, to some questionable business practices, to mary-kate's still-unexplained connection to the death of heath ledger, the olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the tgif lineup. "mary-kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them," miller said in a statement. but in march of 2017, the terms of the settlement were made public, and the olsen twins agreed to pay $140,000 to the approximately "180 present and past interns" who were eligible, according to e! banking on bad movies yeah, mary-kate and ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of michelle tanner on full house (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. mary-kate's kool wedding there are few details about the notoriously press-shy mary-kate's wedding, but like many things in the eccentric twins' life, one tidbit leaked from the nuptials left everyone scratching their heads. it should be said, however, that the tabloid life & style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work mary-kate had done. according to entertainment weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist damien hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called pill cabinets. and while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label the row in 2012. they are living pop culture artifacts after becoming enamoured with the few details surrounding mary-kate's wedding, olsen enthusiasts viviana olen and matt harkin decided to open a pop-up museum dedicated to the strange public persona of the twins. "the u.s. attorney of the southern district decided not to serve olsen with a subpoena," a source told the new york daily news, which effectively let olsen off the hook for any further speculation. according to court documents obtained by radar, the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs, which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover. we're just going to assume it was a jesse & the rippers cd autographed by john stamos because that's the only way we'll feel like these ladies are somewhat relatable humans after reading about their ridiculous store. we'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1. according to the daily mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, mary-kate "sent over her security team who arrived at [ledger's] flat at the same time as the ambulance." amazingly, full house and fuller house creator jeff franklin doesn't consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell us weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he's done asking. the mary-kate - heath ledger connection it seems to have been forgotten over the years that mary-kate was somehow linked with actor heath ledger's death in 2008. at any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering mary-kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. in 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the olsens showed up to the met gala (above), where mary-kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. where mary-kate and ashley are reclusive and cagey, elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. we know we're going to sound like nagging parents here, but seriously, mary-kate and ashley, would it kill you to be a little more like your sister? page six also reported that guests, of which there were only 50, "were required to turn in their cellphones" before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at "a private residence on 49th street, between second and third avenues." according to page six, lead plaintiff lalani and about 40 interns past and present claim they were treated poorly and not compensated for their extremely long hours. the real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as "price upon request," whatever that means. clearly, she wasn't referencing mary-kate and ashley, who famously, and hilariously failed at hiding from the paparazzi so often that artist laura collins created a whole exhibit around their antics. elizabeth olsen is no long lost twin actress elizabeth olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress — 21 years to be exact. elizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews, and she displays a remarkable savvy about how to navigate a-list fame while maintaining her personal life. "i don't know if that comes from growing up in la and having so many examples around me all the time. while there was never any suggestion of foul play, mary-kate's name was involved from the moment the dark knight star's body was discovered. though lalani admits the olsen twins were nice during her brief encounters with them, she feels the company the twins built did not handle its interns properly. when ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his new york city home, the first person she called was mary-kate, twice, instead of 911. stranger still, multiple news sources reported that mary-kate refused to talk to federal investigators about ledger's death unless she was granted immunity. with multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. the twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies — 45 to be exact, according to elle. but taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between elizabeth and the twins. though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business — the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. in spite of all the critical panning, elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. after legal fees, that leaves a whopping $530 per intern who allegedly wasted their entire internship on mundane office work and didn't learn anything about fashion. mary-kate's stonewall tactic eventually worked when the dea and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into ledger's death in august of 2008. on the show," franklin said, adding, "so that's kind of how we feel about the olsen twins. however, their 1995 collaboration with steve guttenberg and kirstie alley, it takes two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on rotten tomatoes. that's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. olsens to paltrow: 'hold our beer' the olsen twins were asked by elle to recommend some christmas gift ideas in 2014. former intern shahista lalani spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the olsen twins' dualstar entertainment group after she felt her duties went beyond the acceptable scope of an internship. how about layaway, because if we can do $5 on that jorgensen, we'll totally be back next week with the rest. exactly how much do the olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare van cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? she went straight to critically-acclaimed indies, such as martha marcy may marlene (2011), then on to mega-hits such as godzilla (2014), the avengers: age of ultron (2015), and captain america: civil war (2016). how do coffee runs, data entry, or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design? then again, mary-kate married olivier sarkozy, a french billionaire, so maybe the cigs and the laissez-faire attitude sort of do make sense. hopefully, the olsen twins are as big a fan of self-deprecation as they are of nicotine. it's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. actually, that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said, "we've stayed quite sheltered." did it have anything to do with ledger's accidental overdose on prescription pills? so you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at. baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch. naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming ashley had altered her appearance, too. how have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled? perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique los angeles shop, the row. smoking and/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. it's something that i watched people doing well growing up." did they build a billion-dollar brand on the backs of overworked interns? the reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. her attorney, michael c. miller, denied she had anything to hide. why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? okay fine, that was ashley, but you get our point. but the timing is so bad for us." "but when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'it's always open!' their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. the olsens are now successful fashion designers. but what about the other details? but we're getting ahead of ourselves here. "it comes quite easily," she told vogue. and she has a point. cool, so we're guessing no clearance rack, right? and they don't smile. the door is open." elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare. it means very expensive.) what opioid crisis? opioid crisis? news. (expensive. his conclusion? mystery solved. how rude!
the description of rotom on bulbapedia (yes, pokemon wiki) goes as follows: so it just turns into white goods whenever it feels like it purely for the purpose of changing it’s power type. there are a couple more pokemon like this, where it seems as though the design team have sat in the office playing "eye spy" until they find an object they could attach a personality to it. we’ve all got that one that we just hate, purely because it looks like something they let the work experience kid draw on a friday evening when nobody else could be bothered. exeggutor it’s quite hard to understand what exeggutor is all about, considering its predecessor is a row of eggs with a name that connotes to eggs, and then it evolves into some coconut tree. it just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and tv series without anybody going "hang on, has anyone else realised this pokemon is pointless?" the designers thought this ice pokemon was such a good idea in fact, that vanilleuxe is the third evolution (after vanillite and vanillish) to be featured in the game. sunabaa (japanese version name)  this pokemon hasn’t been released yet, but it’s coming up on the sun and moon games this year. this pokemon hasn’t been released yet, but it’s coming up on the sun and moon games this year. garbodor it’s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list, as you can imagine but i think i’ve found it in, garbador. luvdisk this pokemon that i could get on board with, if it hadn’t been drawn by what appears to be an under-imaginative child. 13 pokémon the designers just gave up on with 721 to catch, pokémon fans are bound to come across one or two that are just a bit, well, shit. i find this one lazy because they’ve added a scoop of ice-cream to resemble the evolution (similar to dugtrio, dodrio, etc.) this electric pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game – it’s just a pokeball with eyes! there’s no fins or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water, and the super-necessary circle below the eye is almost laughable. the concept is pretty nice it’s a water-type pokemon with a fish-like appearance, shaped like a heart. and because it was a terrible ide, to begin with, and they’ve managed to scrape three new pokemon out of it. so, we’ve trawled through all six generations of pokemon to find the ones that are just bad designs. klefki so we’ll start with the pokemon that inspired me to write this article because it’s a bloody key ring! i’m just waiting for the generation where they’ll add a mysterious set of number pokemon, which is seeming increasingly likely. rotom i’m trying to get my head around this one because it’s just such a strange concept. again, this feels like a feeble attempt to introduce a new pokemon with not much thought put into it. the colours are pretty nasty, and i reckon those blue leaves that are supposed to be wings wouldn’t hold the rest of the weight. dedenne dedenne earned its place because it’s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the much-loved logo and everyone’s favourite, pikachu. unknown (unown) the flying alphabet which seemingly has little functions apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy, but there’s 28 of them regardless including a question and exclamation mark. i’ve never heard of coconuts hatching from eggs but in the pokemon world, anything seems possible. for klefki it might be quite convenient, you’d never lose your keys because they are part of your body. it’s a haunted sandcastle, but that’s about as much as we know. so much more could have been done with that brief than what we’ve got! jynx what even was this supposed to be in the first place? in its description on bulbapedia, it says the pokemon lives in ruins and can swallow up nearby people. voltorb the award for the laziest pokemon design ever has to go to voltorb. i can guarantee you it didn’t take a whole day to design a ditto, did it? its pre-evolution is just a bin bag, not quite yet full enough to split. it’s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arms and a face on its forehead. vanilluxe another one of my favourites because it’s just so awful. looking like charizard’s unloved cousin can’t be all that much fun. the lost potential of this pokemon has landed it on my list. cofagrigus another one of those that’s just a bit, why? yes, as you can see above, it’s an ice-cream cone! i kind of feel sorry for him, being so awkward and all. who ever came up with some of these needs to share what they’re smoking! but it does absolutely nothing for me in the design department. all in all, it just looks a bit silly. it’s a literal pile of rubbish from an overflowing black bag. druddigon award for the most poorly drawn dragon pokemon goes to druddigon. and of all things, they chose a bunch of keys? everything down to the bright cheeks and zig-zagged tail screams cheap imitation – and nobody can replace our pika! jynx makes my list for being just plain creepy. what, how does that happen? how do they get away with this? yeah, you read it right the first time. but it keeps happening. well, now i’m scared. a terrifying large-bosomed-womanhood made for mankind. each to their own.
"she can be arrogant and willful, she is clement and loving, dulcis imperatrix, she is sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when i am away from her, and she loves me!" still, if taylor taught us anything about love, it’s that there are plenty of fish in the sea, so if the person you’re with doesn’t think you’re young or pretty enough, tell them to get lost. 9 things elizabeth taylor taught us about the art of love sure, she was married eight times, but there’s no denying that elizabeth taylor was a woman who knew how to live and love. while her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for life and look magazines, la liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was nbd at a time when divorce wasn’t nearly as accepted as it is now. when it came to love, liz was insatiable — so much so that the vatican accused her of "erotic vagrancy" when she took up with burton, her married co-star in the 1966 film "cleopatra." after that, the couple lived out a totally epic whirlwind romance: marrying in 1964, making up after epic fights time and time again, and eventually divorcing in 1974... only to remarry in a private african ceremony sixteen months later. you would think things would have been awkward between elizabeth taylor and the late debbie reynolds after eddie fisher left reynolds for taylor (the couple’s longtime friend) in 1959. husband richard burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries: "she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography," he wrote. "women liked her and men adored her — my husband included — and her love for her children is enduring," reynolds told entertainment weekly after taylor’s passing. she lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011. with her joie de vivre and insatiable appetite for the opposite sex, taylor had the kind of love life most of us can only dream about. in honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from liz, the fiercest old hollywood dame of all. "i suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up," dame elizabeth once remarked. taylor and burton were so prepared for them, they would reportedly rent three suites when they checked into hotels ― one above and another below their own. we’ve always been partial to taylor’s advice on getting over someone: "pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together." that way, the couple figured, their neighbors would be spared if one of their infamous lovers’ quarrels broke out. taylor reportedly accepted a pave diamond-heart necklace after one of her legendary screaming matches with burton. "people always assume you’re going to carry a grudge, but i don’t do that. "maybe we loved each other too much," elizabeth said, as if such a thing were possible. yeah, we think we could get used to someone fawning over us like that. i am not and couldn’t be," the mom of four once remarked. but what if a relationship doesn’t work out? and it was true — the actress was anything but ordinary. 🙌 but what if a relationship doesn’t work out? "i don’t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. "i’ve always admitted that i’m ruled by my passions," taylor said.

you can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside. after walking through the upper levels for a bit, dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn’t seem to get it off his mind. i don’t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. if you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. well that was the driving force behind a man named dan bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. when he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn’t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings. a tense moment came when dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. the excitement of the unknown is what drives many people’s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. it started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. the snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. have you ever come across an abandoned building and just get the feeling that something amazing could be inside? check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last. that right there would have probably be enough for me to say it’s time to go. he climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. this was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight. inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building. dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. luckily dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway. as with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step. you really don’t have any idea what you’re going to find or discover. it’s so old the wood is rotting and won’t support the weight it used too. it became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. he was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit. the paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren’t even standing anymore. he starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise. this place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used. one guy decided to explore this abandoned building... and instantly regretted it. what happens next is something that i would never want to experience. dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. this isn’t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore. it’s a tense moment in an already tense video. this would be a turning point in the video. he had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. taking risks and going places you aren’t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. he really was lucky to escape with his life. of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further! falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. as soon as i saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. the remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. apparently "tony" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point. this place looks like something out of a horror movie. after examining the contents of the container, dan understandably got seriously freaked out. that’s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! now, i’m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. maybe you’ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. this building is definitely in the slums. this guy is seriously super lucky. it’s never the same thing twice though. trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. the dealer comes back! i do all the time. just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. i’m a responsible adult....sometimes. people have gotten killed for less. well guess what? pretty damn intense right?! well damn!
here's a controversial idea about china's economy that no one wants to hear reuters for years, economists have been saying that china needs to "rebalance" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. the problem with this solution, says hsbc, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that china won't grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term. that means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular chinese people working in the services sector. last week, the us house of representatives held a hearing on the chinese economy , "evaluating the financial risks of china," and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the american steel industry. work, work, work, work, work what really worries hsbc is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, china's total output in 2015 could have been rmb225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual gdp." "based on the experience of some latin american countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). so, to combat that overcapacity, china would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of. hsbc arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. given that china's gdp per capita is only 14% that of the us, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth." that, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors. he also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated rmb45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. it blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. hsbc suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. the bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter. during the hearing, thomas gibson, president of the american iron and steel institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. so what gibson would like is for china to slow its production and wind the steel industry down. that's what hsbc economists qu hongbin and jing li have posited in a recent note, "china's new challenge: faster services expansion, slower productivity growth." that is, china has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term. from the note (emphasis added): "both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. "this kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. in 2009, when the world was falling apart, the chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam. in reality, 300 million tons had been added to china's steel output. from the note (emphasis added): "the efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. but, to be honest, the chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. what if china is transitioning too early? china has a debt-to-gdp ratio of over 280%. meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues. the rest of the world would love that, too. but what if we've got this all wrong? the reason for that is simple: debt. pretty controversial ideas, no?
according to the vet, the plant the dog was chewing on was deadly water hemlock. dog dies one hour after hiking with his owner, veterinarian gives shocking reason why it was a routine walk for one colorado woman and her dog, but it ended in tragedy. if your dog does eat hemlock, it's necessary to induce vomiting and get him to the vet immediately. if dogs eat too much and don't get medical help quickly, this can be followed by respiratory paralysis and death. a few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours. if a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage. in july, the plant thrives in wetlands, marshes and river banks across america, blooming with tiny clusters of white flowers. the three-year-old border collie chewed on some plants as the family took a walk through the horsetooth reservoir. a dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. the woman was shocked by what killed him. shortly after the walk, the dog didn't look well. this will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. he was taken to the vet. an hour later, the dog was dead.
this is what happens when you leave a hotel cleaner a $500 tip instead of encountering a mound of dirty towels and sheets, a cleaner was met with a stack of cash when she walked into a hotel room. kyle and josh from givebackfilms, a youtube channel dedicated to random acts of kindness, surprised a hotel cleaner with a $500 tip this week. the maid's co-worker told kyle and josh, who have also carried out kind deeds such as paying for people's gas and making an ihop waitress's day, that he was shocked by how hardworking she is. the video below shows the stunned cleaner initially refusing to accept the tip, before another hotel worker reassured her by saying, "you deserve it."
this texas gop elector announces that he won't vote for trump a republican elector in texas says he will not formally vote for donald trump for president when members of the electoral college meet on dec. 19. he added that the election of mr. trump is "not yet a done deal" and he urged other electors to "vote their conscience" and unify behind a gop alternative like ohio gov. suprun went on to say mr. trump "lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief" and lambasted him for how he "urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign. in an op-ed published by the new york times, christopher suprun, a paramedic in texas, argued that the president-elect has demonstrated each day that "he is not qualified for the office." it’s called "the electors trust" and it will offer a platform for electors to plan how to stop the president-elect. "he tweets day and night, but waited two days to offer sympathy to the ohio state community after an attack there. while a few dozen states have laws that try to bind the votes of presidential electors, texas is not one of them. harvard university law professor larry lessig has announced that he will provide free counsel to electors who want to oppose  mr.trump, according to politico. suprun would be known as a "faithless elector" and while there have been some in previous elections, they have never changed the outcome. mr. trump, suprun wrote, has failed to unite the country as president george w. bush did after 9/11. instead, he has ranted and attacked the cast of nbc’s "saturday night live." he does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage," he wrote. for me, america is that shining city on a hill that ronald reagan envisioned. these can be met and overcome just as our nation overcame sept. he speaks of retribution against his critics." it has problems. "this is unacceptable. it has challenges. 11." john kasich.

i know how hard it can be but please please practice self love and believe in yourself this alone will make you feel better 💛🌸✨ ------------------------------------------------ a post shared by rachel crawley ☾❂ ॐ (@asprinkleofhealthandbeauty) on mar 3, 2017 at 12:38am pst however, in some of her most recent posts crawley’s skin has significantly cleared up, and for that she credits one simple diet change. 🌟my progress since starting this page🌟 no medication ✖️ high fat vegan plant based diet (nothing processed) real whole foods, natural minimal skin care routine ✔️ people are happy to take strong medication that can lead to bad side effects in are bodies but aren't willing to change there diet which is safe and better for our health. the reason i decided to accept myself for how i looked is because for years i suffered with acne and for years i let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because i was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. most people with acne don't share it because there ashamed but why should we it's only a stage in our life it won't last forever and it certainly doesn't make us any less of a person. this beauty queen cured her acne with one diet change her inspirational journey is encouraging others to do the same a beauty pageant contestant has taken to instagram to share the one thing that helped clear up her aggressive acne. now that she’s changed to a vegan diet, both crawley’s skin and her confidence have increased hugely and she is now a finalist in the miss preston 2017 pageant. it’s one of the most common skincare problems that people experience but that doesn’t detract from how debilitating acne can be; something that rachel crawley knows all too well. i took pictures of my skin so i could see the results as to whether what i was doing was working or not and i started seeing the difference day by day. setting up the account to share her battle with acne, crawley set out to prove that it’s nothing to be ashamed of with a litter of make-up free selfies. for years, she hid away after being bullied for her severe skin condition and despite being approached to participate in a pageant at age 18, crawley turned down the opportunity because she felt too insecure. my scars are being treated with natural skincare products that i have found work my skin and i do want to avoid having any treatments to get rid of them. it's not proven but you know it made me feel better 😅 so apparently acne sufferers skin cells take slower to age = less wrinkles and younger looking skin! after experimenting with taking certain foods out of her diet, she found that sugar and carbs appeared to be the main culprits for her aggressive bouts of acne. fast-forward four years though, and the 22-year-old admin assistant is embracing her breakouts as she documents her skincare journey on instagram with some seriously dramatic before-and-after photos. i knew i couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point i would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. i don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful. unfortunately acne isn't seen as normal and is thought as 'ugly' but it's something so many of us experience. what is to be ashamed of is the perception of what we are supposed to look like. i then decided to give my diet one last change before i would have seen a dermatologist. i get asked how can i be confident when my skin looks like this? ✨7 weeks progress picture ✨the picture on the left was when my skin was at its worst. whatever journey your on to clear you skin don't give up on yourself. they need more role models embracing there real natural selfs because that is real life. i just wanted to share with you all a little study that i found out!! i felt like i wanted to give up at this point. i wanted to share with you the realism of what people go through. because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. i don't want young girls feeling the same way i did. clear skin or acne you are the same person. they need time to heal and i'm okay with that. the picture on the right is my skin today! high fat vegan plant based diet (nothing processed). real whole foods, natural minimal skin care routine." it's nothing to be ashamed of. my acne was cystic, red, sore and i had bumps underneath my skin. obviously this may not be true but you never know. most of us choose not share them. remember that everyone has there struggles in life. no new breakouts!"

"what most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the u.s. government if it were released," said declan mccullagh, chief political correspondent for cnet, a cbs company. the tweets from wikileaks appear to be in line with these prior examples—and surely a true "dead man’s switch" unleashing all the data assange currently possesses would amount to much more than three measly leaks. — anonymous (@youranonnews) october 17, 2016 a gizmodo article described the series of tweets and their less ominous potential purpose: much as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight. essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes. "pre-commitment" in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. a torrent file and accompanying sha-512 hash was even used by someone on reddit’s r/silkroad to share sensitive forum information. the files are encrypted with a code so strong it’s unbreakable, even by governments. if anything happens to assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. there would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies. how do we know that pamela anderson isn’t working 4 someone to set up him up? the same strategy was used by tor project developer andrea shepard in a warning shot that may have helped reveal years of jacob applebaum’s sexual misconduct. likewise, edward snowden tweeted (and quickly deleted) a similar code in august, though its meaning remains uncertain. assange is fine as far as we know. we have activated the appropriate contingency plans. carry on.
